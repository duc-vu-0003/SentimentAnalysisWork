S'films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they\'re about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there\'s never really been a comic book like from hell before . \nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid \'80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \nthe book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \nin other words , don\'t dismiss this film because of its source . \nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell\'s directors , albert and allen hughes . \ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that\'s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london\'s east end . \nit\'s a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called " unfortunates " ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn\'t so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can\'t stomach . \ni don\'t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won\'t go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \nin the comic , they don\'t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \nit\'s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \nand from hell\'s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( " who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? " ) . \ndon\'t worry - it\'ll all make sense when you see it . \nnow onto from hell\'s appearance : it\'s certainly dark and bleak enough , and it\'s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \nthe print i saw wasn\'t completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don\'t say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \noscar winner martin childs\' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \nians holm ( joe gould\'s secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn\'t half bad . \nthe film , however , is all good . \n2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content \n'

aS'every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody\'s surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . \nmtv films\' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . \ndid anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? \nthe plot is deceptively simple . \ngeorge washington carver high school is having student elections . \ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . \nmr . " m " ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . \nand paul\'s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . \nthe dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . \nyou can\'t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . \n_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . \nwhat makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . \nthe similarities are staggering : \ntracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nmax fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nthe most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \nthe most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \ntracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . \nmax fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . \nthe male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe even gets a bee sting . \nthe male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe gets several bee stings . \nand so on . \nwhat happened ? \nhow is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn\'t been fully formed yet ? \neven so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul\'s anti-social sister , tammy . \nbroderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he\'s had since then . \nwitherspoon is a revelation . \nit\'s early in the year , it\'s a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \nand once campbell\'s character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you\'re won over . \none thing that\'s been bothering me since i\'ve seen it . \nthere is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . \ni suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . \nbut the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . \nas the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . \nit is bad enough that mr . m doesn\'t like tracy\'s determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? \neven so , there\'s no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . \nthere\'s a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . \n'

aS"you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . \nin order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . \nno real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . \nessentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . \nit's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . \nbut oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . \nbut there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . \nit couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . \ni haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? \nif you like something so much , why even question it ? \nagain , the storyline is as cliched as they come . \ntom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . \nfox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . \nlittle do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . \nthe rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . \nsure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . \nall of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . \nbut as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . \nwhen ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . \n"

aS' " jaws " is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\' now infamous score . \ndah-dum . \nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once " jaws " has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \nperhaps what is most outstanding about " jaws " is how spielberg builds the movie . \nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\' music . \nhe\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \nhe doesn\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( " it\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine " ) make it that much more terrifying . \nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \n " jaws " is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by " star wars " ) . \neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\'s " psycho , " and it never seems to age . \nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time " jaws " was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\'s right and going against the entire town . \n " it\'s your first summer here , you know , " mayor vaughn warns him . \ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in " american graffiti " ( 1973 ) and " the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz " ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \nhe\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\'s performance is almost a caricature . \nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \nof course , we can\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in " jaws , " and they are a threat . \nevery one of spielberg\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \nthe shark in " jaws " was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed " bruce " by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \nmany have forgotten , but " jaws " was a sort of precursor to " waterworld " ( 1995 ) , a movie\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \n'

aS'moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you\'ve got to know how to allocate your resources . \nevery dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . \nin the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . \nin the movies , you end up with films like " spawn " , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . \njackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . \nhe spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . \nwatching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn\'t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . \nbut like the lions star , jackie doesn\'t have anybody to block for him . \nalmost every cent that\'s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . \nthis leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . \nthis also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . \n ( chan\'s first release in this country , " rumble in the bronx " , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) \nheck , jackie doesn\'t even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . \nin condor , chan plays the same character he\'s always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . \njackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . \nhe is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , " jackie , save us ! " , and misuse firearms . \nthe villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he\'s more pathetic than evil . \nen route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . \nonce at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film\'s centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that\'s even better than the one in face/off . \nthis is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . \nignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain\'s legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn\'t he take the key with him ? ) . \ndon\'t worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . \njust go see the movie . \noperation condor has pretentions of being a " raiders of the lost ark " knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . \nhowever , you\'ve got to go with what you\'ve got , and what you\'ve got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize . \n'

aS'on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in " lumumba . " \npatrice lumumba\'s ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , " lumumba - death of a prophet , " virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \nlumumba won\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\'s and 60\'s . \n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \nthe effort involved in " lumumba " is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\'s life . \nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \nthe family side of patrice\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \n " lumumba " is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \n'

aS"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . \ni've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \nas it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \nit's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \nthe film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \nwe find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \nin the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \nmuch of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . \nwhen derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \nit's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \nbecause american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \nit's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \nit's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \nin addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \neven when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \nvisually , the film is very powerful . \nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \nit's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \n"

aS'one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy\'s wedding . \nand she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . \nher reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn\'t made a worthwhile film since 1986 . \nbut the fact is , betsy\'s wedding is also an alan alda film . \nand while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . \nwritten and directed by alda , betsy\'s wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . \nalda\'s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . \nas bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . \nwalsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . \nringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . \nshe looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . \nshe\'s supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . \nand to make matters worse , ringwald\'s performance matches her appearance . \nthankfully , alda keeps ringwald\'s screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . \nthe wedding is just a device to bring together the bride\'s working-class , italian family and the groom\'s rich , gentile family . \nringwald\'s folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . \nwalsh\'s clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . \nwhen the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , " money versus values . " \nally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film\'s most pleasant surprises . \nsheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . \nit\'s anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . \nlapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . \nlapaglia\'s sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . \nand what\'s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . \nlapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . \ni don\'t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia\'s over-the-top performance should not be missed . \nthe scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . \njoe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda\'s unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o\'hara ) . \nalda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride\'s financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . \nthe film adopts alda\'s psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . \nas a filmmaker , alda\'s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . \nand while he doesn\'t have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . \n'

aS'after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo . \ntheir officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo\'s army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals . \nwith unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country\'s resources , proclaimed secession . \nlumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification \ntour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late . \n\'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , \' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . \npeck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba\'s private life . \npeck\'s script illuminates bantu sayings like \'the hand that gives , rules\' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . \npeck\'s direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare . \nhe\'s served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role . \nebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character\'s fierce passion for his people and his country . \nlumumba\'s intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he\'s cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney . \npeck\'s subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production . \n " lumumba " is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney\'s performance makes the tragedy personally felt . \n'

aS"the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . \nit's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . \nsometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . \nquality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . \nbut too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . \nflying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . \nmostly it's laughable . \nin hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . \nbut iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . \niron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . \nbut it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . \nunlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . \niron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . \niron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . \nhowever , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . \nin those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . \nwhile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . \naka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . \n"

aS'after watching " rat race " last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film\'s 112 minutes . \nsaturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn\'t enjoy it as much the second time as the first . \n " rat race " is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . \nhands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . \nthe movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a \'60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . \nthen comes the setup . \ndonald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . \nto that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . \ngathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , " today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . " \nthe competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . \nthere is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . \nthe race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . \nsince it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let\'s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . \ndecked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . \nshe finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . \nthrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . \nowen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . \nan nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . \nafter escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . \nmr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . \nhe also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . \npollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . \nrandy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . \nfearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . \nbeverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . \nbrothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . \nblaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . \nthe boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . \nfinally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . \nat first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . \ndirector jerry zucker ( " airplane , " " ghost " ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . \nas with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . \nhigh points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . \nhad i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby\'s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . \nit would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . \ni also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . \nmy god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing " all star ? " \nbut enough carping . \n " rat race " is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . \nsee it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for . \n'

aS'i\'ve noticed something lately that i\'ve never thought of before . \npseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . \nhave you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? \nmore and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . \ni\'m not trying to say city of angels is that bad . \nit had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . \nsomehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . \nthe predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . \nbut for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . \nnicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . \nmeg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we\'re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . \nafter losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient\'s transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . \nhe begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . \nangels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . \nseth\'s adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . \nthe angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it\'s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . \ncage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . \nit\'s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . \nthe two aren\'t very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual " intelligently ditzy " romantic comedy roles , and it\'s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . \nbut even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . \nit\'s a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn\'t know quite how to get to it . \nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . \nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . \nbased on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . \nmost movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . \nnonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories . \n'

aS'synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) . \nbobby\'s world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . \nthen one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby\'s house . \nted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . \nas the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted\'s great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . \nreview : a small but enchanting movie , " hearts in atlantis " easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , " stand by me " , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . \n " hearts " is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends . \nunlike " stand by me " , there is a supernatural element to " hearts " , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent . \nlike " stand by me " , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting . \nyelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation . \nmore splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in " along came a spider " and who is simply radiant here as carol . \nand then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen . \nless successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish . \ni also found it odd that bobby and carol\'s other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie\'s flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention . \nbut hicks\' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie\'s general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience . \n'

aS"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . \ncinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . \ntechnically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . \nlawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . \nthree lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . \na final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . \nopinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . \nin fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . \nreal life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . \nspielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . \ndjimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . \n"

aS'the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment\'s notice . \nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \nwhat if he\'s also able to think on his feet ? \nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\'s the negotiator . \nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\'s office . \ni don\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , " i hate to do this , but . . . " , \nalthough it wouldn\'t surprise me if he did . \nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \nalthough roman\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \nhow can we believe he\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\'s acting ability . \nalmost every time he\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \nhis is an interesting character . \nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \n " i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , " he says . \nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \ngray really lucked out with this cast . \ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \nfortunately , this doesn\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\'s reality . \nwe\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \nas an audience , we\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \n'

aS'plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he\'s devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . \ncritique : i\'m a sucker for movies like this . \na young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . \nin the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . \nhis entry and adaptation to the whole " rock \'n roll " lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . \nalthough i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . \nmetal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn\'t that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . \nthat\'s not to say that you won\'t like this film if you don\'t like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . \nbut the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . \nwow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film\'s original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . \nhe is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . \nhe came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . \naniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn\'t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . \ni was also impressed by some of the " real " musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . \nit\'s to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . \njust for the record , i\'m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it\'s a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . \noh yeah , and for those who dig the " heavier " side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! \nyou see . . . dreams \ncan come true . . . \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \nalmost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) \n'

aS'carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . \nmade in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . \nsid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . \nthe jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . \nthis time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . \nthe doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - " i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other !

aS'the ultimate match up between good and evil , " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone\'s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \nthis developed hatred is before the film\'s hero , ness , is even introduced . \ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \nthe film only gets better from this point . \nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \none that comes to mind is " the matrix " when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930\'s style , the similarities between these two are countless . \n " the untouchables " has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone\'s army . \neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \nhe teaches him " the chicago way " to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . \nconnery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . \nandy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . \nas ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . \ncharles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . \nsmith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . \nthe action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . \nalso very similar to " the matrix , " they are exciting and intense . \n>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . \nthe score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . \nits pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . \nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . \nalthough the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . \nsome scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . \n'

aS'having not seen , " who framed roger rabbit " in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . \nwatching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is . \naside from the fact that it\'s a milestone in animation in movies ( it\'s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it\'s also quite an effective comedy/mystery . \nwhile the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . \nthe story begins in hollywood in 1947 . \ncartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . \nmaroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger\'s mind back on work . \nmaroon thinks that roger\'s wife , jessica\'s , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots . \nvaliant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake\' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . \nupon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect . \nthe rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger\'s good name . \nalong the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who\'s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . \' \n`who framed roger rabbit\' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . \ndirector robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . \nalso bob hoskins\' performance should be credited . \nhe , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . \naccording to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . \n`who framed roger rabbit\' is a rare film . \none that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . \ndo yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please .

aS'there\'s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . \nstiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? \nhe\'s in " there\'s something about mary , " which i * still * haven\'t seen . \nand he\'s in the acerbic " your friends & neighbors , " playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . \nnow there\'s " permanent midnight , " in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . \nthere\'s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they\'ve proved themselves commercially . \newan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in " emma " and " brassed off , " received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle\'s transatlantic junk-fest , " trainspotting . " \nthe philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want \'em to be taken seriously , make \'em do drugs . \n " permanent midnight " is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . \na habit , in stahl\'s own words , " the size of utah . " \nas stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance . \nunlike " trainspotting , " which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , " permanent midnight " instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance . \none of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to " naked lunch " author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , " so i can shave . " \nstahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in " permanent midnight " ; it\'s so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills . \nwhile the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl\'s autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed . \n " permanent midnight " shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author\'s words-- " escape the drug scene " ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you\'d swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings . \nstahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown\'s own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time . \njaneane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that\'s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor . \nstiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top . \nthe ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see " permanent midnight " ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living . \n'

aS'by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard\'s ransom . \ngibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . \ntom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . \nminutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom\'s house and wiring every phone . \nthe plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you\'ve already seen , and it was nothing more than that . \nthat is until about half-way through the movie . \nsuddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom . \nbut this is as close as you will ever get to it . \ninstead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . " \nat this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . \nthe last half of the film is very well done . \nanother thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . \nowen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . " \nbefore this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 . \nbut he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad . \ngibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance . \nalthough most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film . \n , \n'

aS"one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . \nthe purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . \nsometimes the stories are compelling . \nsometimes they're not . \nbut , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . \nstar trek : insurrection is no exception . \nthe film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . \nit's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . \nsome say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . \nothers say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . \ni simply enjoyed the film . \ninsurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . \nof course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . \nmurray abraham ) , to mess everything up . \nthe son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . \nthat's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . \nso , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . \nwhen dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . \nthis is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . \ninsurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . \nstewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . \njonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . \nfrakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . \nthis is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . \nif i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . \ni don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . \nbetter yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? \ninsurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . \nwith it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . \ni prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . \n"

aS'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \n>from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters . \n1996\'s the cable guy was supposed to be his big " breakthrough " role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . \nas most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar . \nnot only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics . \nas far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . \nthe first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn\'t really like it . \nhowever , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i\'ve had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . \nand to my surprise , it grew on me . \nthe plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . \nsee , steven\'s been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn\'t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . \nalso , some of the cable guy\'s antics have been creeping him out . \ncarrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn\'t enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done . \nfor me , its not the movie as a whole that\'s enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven\'s apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . \nperhaps the fact that more of carrey\'s humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . \nand if you really want to see something , you\'ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane\'s " somebody to love " , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . \nthe cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . \ni didn\'t particularly like steven\'s girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . \nalso , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . \nstill , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you\'re at the video store and can\'t think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . \nor if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won\'t have to wait long . ) \nhell , that\'s what i do every day . \n'

aS'when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ? \nthere have been several recent political films that didn\'t do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? \nbulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression . ? \nit\'s a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story . \n ? \nbeatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again . ? \nhe hasn\'t slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane . \n ? he\'s not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he\'s definitely bonkers . \n ? it\'s the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto . \n ? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ? \n " you mean , " one lady asks , " the democratic party doesn\'t care about the african american community ? " ? \n " well , " he shouts , laughing , " isn\'t that obvious ? " \nthe story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it\'s a bad thing to make decisions when you\'re suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman . \n ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated . \n ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth\'s no-nonsense " truth in politics " methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he\'s appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . \nbeatty\'s work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ? \nhis script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ? \nhere is a man who\'s reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ? \ni like that the film doesn\'t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ? \nsome of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ? \nmuch of the film is completely absurd , but that\'s the fun part about it . ? \nit\'s an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ? \nwhat adds to this feeling is beatty\'s portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale . \n ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he\'s always funny , but he\'s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions . \n ? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . \nthe supporting cast is vast and colorful . ? \nberry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ? \ndon cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ? \noliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he\'s very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . \nis bulworth offensive ? ? \ni suppose some may see it that way . ? \ni wasn\'t offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ? \ni think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ? \nthe film isn\'t perfect , of course -- the ending didn\'t quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ? \nbut these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ? \nbulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ? \n'

aS'call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . \nthe finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . \nyou look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . \nwe will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . \nin gridlock\'d , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . \nshakur and roth play ezekiel " spoon " whitmore and alexander " stretch " rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . \nwhen a new year\'s eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . \nthey soon make a new year\'s resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . \nas though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . \nthe government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . \nin order for you to buy into gridlock\'d at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year\'s day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . \ngridlock\'d may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991\'s falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . \nin falling down , michael douglas\' d-fens ( the character\'s personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock\'d by the drug lord d-reper\'s plates ) whips out a gun because he can\'t get breakfast at mcdonald\'s ; in gridlock\'d , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . \nand where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . \none bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , " do you expect the world to stop . . . just \nbecause you picked _today_ to clean up ? " \nthe world in gridlock\'d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . \nhall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . \na significant chunk of gridlock\'d is devoted to spoon and stretch\'s flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . \nin one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . \nthe entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . \nhall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film\'s main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . \noh , the irony of it . \ntupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . \nin gridlock\'d , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . \nspoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . \nmostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . \nit is spoon who plays conscience to stretch\'s pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon\'s goal as any agency or enemy . \ngridlock\'d\'s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch " helping " spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . \nwith friends like that , spoon doesn\'t need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . \nthe tragedy now is that we won\'t get more chances to see those eyes again . \n'

aS'hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o\'halloran and jeff anderson ) . \nthey spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . \nthe premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film\'s budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this . \noriginally rated nc-17 for language . \nnot recommended for viewers with sensitive ears . \nkilling zoe =========== \nremake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you\'re halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary\'s slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery . \neric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers . \nhe\'s the safecracker who\'s blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go . \nthough intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino . \nin english and french . \nthe road to wellville ===================== \nbased on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn\'t go very far . \nbowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900\'s , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation . \nhe also invented the cornflake . \nreally . \nchecking-in to kellogg\'s battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy . \nleave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey . \nthe art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama . \nwhat he ends up with is something that i can\'t print here . \nphew ! \nstargate ======== \nlawrence of arabia meets star wars . \nthis epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else . \ndirector roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on . \nthe film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history . \nthat said , there\'s still plenty to watch here . \nsci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader . \nhe plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that " somebody else " built the pyramids . \nless interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame . \nstar trek generations ===================== \ntrek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best . \nthe story is interesting , but each scene goes too long . \nthe cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch . \nand so on . \n ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . ) \noriginal enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead " get a life . " \nremarkably unremarkable . \nmiracle on 34th street ====================== \nin a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary . \njohn hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original . \nthe romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn\'t work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle . \nhis chemistry with children can moisten any eye . \nno claus for alarm . \njunior ====== \narnold schwarzenegger pregnant ? \nsure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie . \nwhat should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along . \ndirector ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect . \ndon\'t expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can\'t beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie . \nhow\'s * that * for a collision of acting styles ? \n'

aS'for those of us who weren\'t yet born when the 1960\'s rock \'n\' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . \nfrom otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . \nbut i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . \nshot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . \nsure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . \npennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . \nno matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . \nthe excitement starts before the music even begins . \na young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . \nthere are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . \nand when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , " finally , a decent sound system ! " \nyou can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn\'t about vanity , it\'s about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . \nthis interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . \nit\'s impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . \nand while the lyrics to " wild thing " may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . \neven if you don\'t recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . \nthe only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . \nall the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . \nin contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . \nfor a film that\'s only 78 minutes long , that\'s too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . \nall in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . \nthe variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . \nif there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . \nit\'s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn\'t get made much anymore . \ninstead we\'re stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling . \n'

aS'the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola\'s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola\'s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \nbut the perfect world of " wiseguys " gradually begins to fall apart - tommy\'s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy\'s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry\'s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \nscorsese also manages to break viewer\'s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character\'s dialogue or narrator\'s commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \neven if we don\'t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie\'s ironic prologue . \nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn\'t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious " a day in life " segment near the end of the film . \nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \njoe pesci deserved his " oscar " for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn\'t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \nliotta\'s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \n'

aS' " the blair witch project " was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . \nits success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . \nafter the release of " the blair witch project " , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . \nlocals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , " get out of these woods and go home ! \nthere is no goddamned blair witch ! " . \njeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . \nafter he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . \nas the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the " blair witch hunt " . \namong the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called " the blair witch : history or hysteria ? " , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . \nthe last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying " the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . " \nthis strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . \non the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr\'s abandoned house , strange things start happening . \nwhen they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . \nafter a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . \nthey are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . \nthey are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality . \nthe only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . . \ndocumentary director joe berlinger ( " paradice lost " ) helms " blair witch 2 " , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . \nthe opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . \nbut soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . \nin a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . \nmore money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . \nthe horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . \nof course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . \nfrom its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell\'s ( " being john malkovich " and " fargo " ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with " the blair witch project " . \n " blair witch . . " \nwas filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . \nin the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . \nwith its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . \nand though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . \nthe key is simplicity . \n " blair witch project " had a story which was incredibly simple . \nthat allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination . \nthe film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . \nthe effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way . \n " book of shadows " feels incredibly controlled and restrict . \nhere , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and " clever " that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it . \nthere is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with . \nthis is simply a less artistic film that doesn\'t have the talent and originality of its predecessor . \nit resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn\'t always succeed . \nbut most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn\'t allow it to destroy the original . \nin the end , i can\'t call it a bad effort . \nit\'s less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad . \nit\'s simply different . \nin fact , if you haven\'t seen " the blair witch project " , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between " the blair witch project " and the " scream " -films . \nthe only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . \nbut it\'s a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . \nto me the story of " the blair witch project " seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that " the book of shadows " is certainly assured . \nand it\'s already time to look forward to " blair witch 3 " . \n'

aS"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . \none of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . \nwith some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . \nthere's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \n"

aS'linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma\'s lead is nothing short of inexplicable . \nshe\'s still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who\'s lost her faith . \none night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany\'s bedroom . \nhe is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . \ngod would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . \nbethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the " prophets " jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith\'s films thus far . \nat some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) " thirteenth apostle " , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . \nit\'s a wild ride . \nthey\'re in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . \nloki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . \nat one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . \nit\'s a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , " how corrupt are you ? " . \nwings of desire this ain\'t . \nsince debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . \n ( chris rock is this film\'s only weak link-between jokes , he\'s wooden . ) \nhis no-frills visual style hasn\'t changed much over the years , though ( dogma\'s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . \ndogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . \nas well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . \nany movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma\'s pacing goes slack . \na long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we\'ve heard enough . \nbecause his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki\'s bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . \nsure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . \nlike tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . \ndogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! \nsmith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan " catholicism wow ! " ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . \ni bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . \nproceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . \nit\'s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . \nthe prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ\'s , martin scorsese\'s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis\' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture\'s content but to rumours and heresy . \nthere\'s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . \n ( not one of them had watched it . ) \nevery single person refused . \nsmith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith\'s bethany and scorsese\'s jesus are hollow shells without their faith . \nin fact , dogma\'s denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that\'s worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . \n ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don\'t belong to . \nnow that\'s powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . \nit\'s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . \nmy religion is movies . \nwhen the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they\'re attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . \ni therefore feel that , although i\'m no bible-thumper , i\'m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . \n'

aS'you\'ve heard all the hype . \nyou\'ve seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler\'s list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . \nif you\'ve read any reviews , you\'ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . \nyou also may have heard that this one\'s too kiddie-friendly , and doesn\'t have enough content for adults . \nbelieve the hype . \nthe effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala\'s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . \nbut there\'s something missing here , and it isn\'t budget or effects - it\'s everything money * can\'t * buy . \nthe actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . \nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . \nhe is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . \nportman\'s queen amidala and mcgregor\'s obi-wan kenobi don\'t fare nearly so well . \namidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he\'s nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn\'s batman . \nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness\' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that\'s one of the problems with this film . \ni would never call myself a " star wars " fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i\'ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn\'t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn\'t bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \nfor example , one of the film\'s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \nfor those of you not recently steeped in " star wars " trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader\'s master in " return of the jedi " and " empire strikes back . " \nso , obviously , his appearance in " phantom menace " is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \na lot of the movie is like that . \nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it\'s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience\'s pre-existing fondness for them . . . \nbecause he doesn\'t do much to add to it in any way . \nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn\'t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from " empire strikes back " ) , and alderaan ( leia\'s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in " star wars " ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \nwhat\'s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \nthere\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive " teenage mutant ninja turtles . " \nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \noddly , this isn\'t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \nwell , he\'s done a good job . \nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \nthat\'s not jake lloyd\'s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \nthat\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin\'s future evil in the film . \nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn\'t all hearts and roses is yoda\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \nhis explanation ? \n " his future is clouded . " \n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \nenter at your own risk . ) \nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin " darth vader " skywalker . \ndid this story need to be told ? \ni would say no . \nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \nabsolutely . \nif you don\'t enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \nabove all , this is a fun movie . \nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \nbut fun . \nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed " empire " will direct . \nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \n : ) \n'

aS'as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . \nthe shot has tibbs\' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . \nto see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . \nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . \nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . \nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . \n " in the heat of the night " was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \npreceding the very original " a soldier\'s story " and the recently released " the hurricane , " " in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \nhowever , unlike " the hurricane " where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \nhe would refer to tibbs as " boy " and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger\'s character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \njewison\'s determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \n " in the heat of the night " shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960\'s . \nit displays this perfectly . \nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . \nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . \n ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . \nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , " in the heat of the night " and the even better " in cold blood . " ) \n'

aS'in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . \never since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80\'s . \nin those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . \nyou\'d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . \nin wonder boys his performance isn\'t showy or a tour de force , it\'s simple yet truthful . \nhe embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . \ngrady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . \nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . \ngrady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . \ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . \nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . \nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . \nhe\'s portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . \nhe reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . \nwhenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . \nleer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . \ntobey maguire fits well in the role . \nwith his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . \nbut unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he\'s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . \nkatie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady\'s pants . \nthis is a plot line i had trouble with . \ndouglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . \nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it\'s because i\'m jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas\'s real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . \nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . \nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i\'m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . \nthere is a movie in there somewhere . \ngrady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . \nokay , maybe not so chivalrous . \nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , " she was a junkie for the printed word . \nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice " . \nrobert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . \ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . \nhe\'s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . \nthe actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . \ni wish wonder boys had more of him . \nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that\'s part of its charm . \nand maybe i\'m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i\'m greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . \neveryone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . \ni\'m privy to films about literary types i . e . \nthose individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . \nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . \nsometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that\'s a problem i wish i found with films more often . \nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . \nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . \nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . \nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn\'t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . \ncurtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin\' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . \nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . \nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . \nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . \nit\'s the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . \nmany will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . \n'

aS'plot : derek zoolander is a male model . \nhe is also very dumb and impressionable . \nfor that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn\'t know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country . \nwill zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? \nwill zoolander ever grace the world his new " look " ? \nis this a funny movie ? \nfind out below . . . \ncritique : there\'s a place in our world for " stupid comedies " . \nfilms which don\'t pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes . \nthere\'s also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to " relax " by watching something so completely frivolous . \nwell , if you\'re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time . \nof course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the " stupid " , but consider it funny instead . \ni personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry . \nsnap ! \nit was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously . \nand if you\'re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don\'t look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others . \ni especially liked andy dick\'s complete make-over as the masseuse . \nhi-larious ! \nbut with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn\'t work . \na few particulars which didn\'t strike my fancy included the bulimia and " orgy " sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just " make up " a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) . \ni also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn\'t all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! ) . \nbut those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ! \ni almost pissed myself during the " gas station " disaster , absolutely adored the " walk-off " contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander\'s moronic one-liners ( " i was a merman . . . a \nmerman ! ! " ) . \nand i dare you to get his " monkey " photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ( " you\'re a monkey , derek . . . a \nmonkey ! " ) \ni also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all . \nagain , it\'s to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well . \nif you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here . \nblue steel , baby . . . yeah ! ! ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \naustin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers 2 ( 7/10 ) - deuce bigalow ( 7/10 ) - dude , where\'s my car ( 7/10 ) - freddy got fingered ( 5/10 ) - jay & silent bob strike back ( 8/10 ) - joe dirt ( 5/10 ) - meet the parents ( 8/10 ) - say it isn\'t so ( 3/10 ) \n'

aS'unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi\'s lover at the time ) freely admits that he " couldn\'t care less about the truth " but was more interested in capturing " the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . " \ndespite violating nearly every rule of " legitimate " documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he\'s funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( " it\'s about women not wanting to look like cows " ) to mary tyler moore ( " between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country " ) to style ( " it\'s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs " ) . \nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \nit\'s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi\'s development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience\'s perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \nwhile unzipped isn\'t an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \nwhen the designer declares that " everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that\'s beautiful and liberating , " it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \n'

aS'dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station . \nshe , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states . \nshe writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts . \nshe+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . \ntotally trustworthy , right ? \nnot a chance . \nonce home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) . \none of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father . \nshortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . \ndays go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . \nthrough a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . \nthis means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . \nfilms like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films . \nit is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own . \nit does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly . \nand yet , it+s backdrop is merely that . \nthe focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . \nthe most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . \ndora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . \nbut neither side is trivialized . \nshe even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially . \nfernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? . \nhe , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states . \nhe is a natural , and never once grating . \nsend a memo to jonathan taylor thomas . \n'

aS'the event of events is upon us . \npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \ni don\'t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \nanyone who tells you " it\'s just a movie " is either lying or clueless . \nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \nin fact , it is terrific . \ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as " the force " ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie\'s real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nhe is an innocent slave boy , but " the force is strong with him " so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor\'s movie . \naround 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \nhe\'s essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like " exqueeze me ? " \nand " mesa go now , okeday ? " , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn\'t already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term " popcorn movie " . \nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \nwhen you see " a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away " , when the familiar music plays , when the words " star wars " appear on screen , you\'ll feel a tingle even if you didn\'t see the movie when it first came out in \'77 . \nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we\'re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n'

aS'sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest . \nsome people call it " original " or " artsy " or " abstract " . \nsome people simply call it " trash " . \na life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings . \ndefinitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence . \nwhew ! \nanyone in their 30\'s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film . \nit\'s somewhat silly , it\'s somewhat outrageous , and it\'s definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works . \na lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting . \nwell sorry folks , but i haven\'t seen trainspotting so i can\'t really compare . \nwhether that works in this film\'s favor or not is beyond me . \nbut i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me . \nhe was great ! \ncameron diaz\'s character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp . \nthe audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him . \nmisguided ? \nyou bet . \nloveable ? \nyou bet . \na life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah . \nthis was just one more thing i didn\'t know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke . \nmaybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy . \na life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming ! \nnot for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies . \n'

aS'that thing you do ! \n ( r ) tom hanks\'s screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice . \nit is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this \'60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . \nthat thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , " that thing you do ! " \nthe group\'s members are , naturally a diverse group : there\'s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film\'s center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . \nalong for the wonders\' ride to success is jimmy\'s perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . \nhanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls " the last innocent year . " \nthe spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it\'s still playing in my mind as i write this ) . \nit should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film\'s biggest and best dramatic moment . \nthe work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early \'60s ; they do not appear to be \'90s grungers playacting " retro . " \nyet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it\'s nearly nice to a fault . \nwhile this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . \neveryone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note . \nthere isn\'t much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks\'s turn as the wonders\' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it\'s bland . \nbut a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there\'s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it\'s just about impossible to hate . \nit\'s an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , " that thing you do ! " --quite \npossibly for days . \nto paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play " that thing you do ! " \n'

aS' " he\'s back , and it\'s about time . " \nwas the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don\'t care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . \nthe motto was well chosen . \nthe series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . \nas good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . \nis it the acting ? \nhell , no ! \npaul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who\'ve played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . \nhe looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . \ndaphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor\'s first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . \nyoung yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i\'ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . \nthe only problem with the acting is eric roberts . \none time he had to say to mcgann\'s doctor , " i always dress for the occasion . " \nbut he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , " i always . . . \ndress . . . \nfor the occasion . " \nyou need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who\'s also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . \nexecutive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . \ni dunno who thought of casting him , but if they\'re reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! \nhe rides on his sister\'s coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . \nis this problem the kisses to the past ? \nthey have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they\'re good . \nis it the script or the movie as a whole ? \nthe script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . \nso what is it ? \nsimple : no plot . \nthe master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . \nthe doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee\'s help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn\'t close it by then . \nvirtually no plot . \ni was told the movie would\'ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . \nthat shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would\'ve gotten a four star rating out of me . \n'

" \nwith that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life . \nlester works for an advertising agency . \nhis growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering . \nestranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress . \nhis life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy . \ncarolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker . \nshe carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings . \nbut inside she is desperate . \nunsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . \nthe third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn\'s daughter . \na young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . \nthis funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . \nnot one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . \nsome of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . \nmost notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . \nshe has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . \ncolonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . \nhis rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham\'s . \nin fact they are the next door neighbors . \nanymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in " american beauty " . \nalan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series " cybil " and creator of the new sitcom " oh grow up " , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . \nnot one character in this film rings falsely . \nand the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . \nthe plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as " the graduate " or " lolita " . \nkevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . \nhis lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . \nfinally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . \nhe quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year\'s salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter\'s girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . \nmr . spacey\'s performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . \nannette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . \ncarolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . \nunable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . \nms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . \nthe slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . \nthora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . \njane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . \nher growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . \nshe is the prototypical trophy child . \nwhen carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( " i\'m so proud of you , honey . \nyou didn\'t screw up once ! " ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . \nthora birch is a young actress to watch . \npraise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . \ncolonel finn is a man in complete denial . \nhis military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . \nwes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . \nthe boy next door who may be more foe than friend . \na deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . \nmr . bentley\'s performance is the one troublesome note in the film . \nthat is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . \ndirector sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . \nscenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . \nthe subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it\'s harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . \nevery nuance of " american beauty " begs it\'s audience to think and examine . \nit is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . \nand well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . \n'

aS'will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . \nfor a movie character , that\'s usually a death sentence . \nit\'s a trait associated with what my brother calls " too good for this world " movies , like phenomenon or powder . \nforgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn\'t die . \nthis is no formula movie . \nin fact , it\'s quite fresh and original . \nit\'s a character study more than anything , and that\'s not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . \nwill works whatever kind of job he can get . \nfirst he\'s a janitor , then he works construction . \noff-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . \non-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . \nlambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . \nhaving confirmed he\'s not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . \nhe is firmly rejected . \nfinally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . \nlambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . \nwill ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . \nlambeau treats will like a son . \nhe\'s proud of , and amazed by , will\'s accomplishments in mathematics . \nhe encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . \nwill isn\'t really interested in academia . \nhe knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . \nhe would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau\'s heart . \nmeanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . \nit\'s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau\'s " a " list . \nwill has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . \nshrink after shrink refuses to return after will\'s mockery . \nlambeau\'s last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . \nknowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . \ntrue to form , will finds sean\'s emotional weakness and attacks . \nbut unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . \nlike a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . \nlike the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . \nrobin williams is excellent in this role . \nhe\'s not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . \nin this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . \nwilliams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . \ni have compared will to a foster child and that\'s not entirely fair . \nemotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . \nhe has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . \nsean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn\'t start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . \nhis exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . \nif i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . \nit\'s too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . \nit is emotionally engaging , but it\'s not quite larger than life . \nthis isn\'t a problem per se , but at times i didn\'t know quite how to take it . \nbut this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . \na good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . \nit doesn\'t just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . \ngood will hunting has all three . \nif you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go . \n'

aS'if there\'s one thing in common about all of hollywood\'s major studios , it\'s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it\'s obvious there\'s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \nso when a movie like gary ross\' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it\'s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross\' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named " pleasantville . " \nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \nit\'s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \nfine performances are turned in all around . \nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman\'s envy . \nfor daniels , it\'s his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it\'s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \nthere\'s not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don\'t . \n'

aS'what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg , and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world , harrison ford ? \nyou get one hot-fudge-rockin\' good time , that\'s what you get ! ! ! \nplot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it . \nadventures , snakes , romance and mucho action ensues . \ncritique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action , stunts galore , an interesting story line , great one-liners , a solid cast , a catchy musical score , and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride . \nif you don\'t enjoy this film , then you just don\'t like action movies , period ! \nif you\'re young , you\'ll enjoy its humor , its cool action sequences and its gross-out factor at times . \nif you\'re a little older , you\'ll appreciate the interesting plot line , the romance , and yes , the mountains of adventure . \nwatching this movie made me feel like a kid again , dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys , travelling to different countries , making the impossible , possible ! \nharrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer , and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action , fun , adventure and humor . \nnow if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven ! \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture . \nit lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound . \nactor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , " magnum p . i . " . \nin filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on . \nhence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas . \nhowever , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well . \nlooking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not . \nan early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra . \nduring his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong . \nalso in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence . \nboth of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984\'s indiana jones and the temple of doom . \nthis film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo . \nthe same type of opening is present in its sequels . \njock\'s airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number " ob-cpo " . \nthis is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas\' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) . \nalso , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po . \nthey can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark . \nthe script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip . \nas legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . \nspielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy . \nthe entire crew laughed and that\'s how it was filmed . \nwhen indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake\'s reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that . \nwhen indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier\'s truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he\'s being dragged on . \n'

aS"`we run tings . \ntings don't run we . ' \n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . \nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \nthe end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . \noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \nif action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . \nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \ni'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . \n"

aS'at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . \nthat\'s true of home alone 2 and i\'d bet money that it\'s true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . \nbut home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn\'t get in the way . \nthe mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . \nfour adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . \nthe littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids\' cruelty . \nkevin\'s patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he\'s going to have to starve . \nhe attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . \nthe fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . \nthe knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . \nnobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . \nthe ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o\'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . \non his way up the stairs , he tells her that " families suck " and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . \nthat night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . \nin a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . \nit\'s interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . \nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . \nthey\'re two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . \nmeanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . \nhe\'s finally rid of his family ! \nlife is a dream come true . \nhe can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother\'s secret box . \nslowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . \nhe grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( " i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener " ) . \nhe also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . \nthe furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . \nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn\'t much of an actor . \nstill , we can see that kevin\'s character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . \nfor example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as " santa " is getting in his car . \nkevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . \nhe learned how to deal with the furnace . \nyou turn on the lights and it\'s not so scary anymore . \nhe goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . \nthey talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . \nfinally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . \nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie\'s genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . \nit\'s a lot of fun , and it doesn\'t overwhelm the rest of the movie . \non the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . \njohn williams\' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . \nbut it does have its flaws . \nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn\'t act very well . \nas i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin\'s insight into his character . \nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin\'s life about five times . \ninstead of " i\'m gonna get that kid " they say " i\'m gonna kill that kid . " \nsome might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . \nmixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . \ni\'ll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . \ndon\'t let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . \n'

aS"-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- \nsummary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! \nto premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . \nhe hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . \nwe see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . \nquick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . \nthe mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . \nunlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . \nthe makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . \nthe performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . \nso i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . \nlonger , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] \nthe primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . \ntoo many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . \nyou watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . \nmatinee is not like that . \ni left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . \ni found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . \nbut most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . \nthe comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . \ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . \nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally . \ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . \nthe other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . \nthe movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . \ni thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . \nthey tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . \nunfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . \nwhile the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . \nseveral aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . \none example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . \nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . \nanother reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . \none of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . \n ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) \nwhile mant ! \nnever got made , many films like it were , and mant ! \nserves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . \nso again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . \nthis isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . \nenjoy ! \n"

aS'when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . \nwhen the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . \nwhen han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . \ncool . \n_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . \nwas it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? \nhave we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? \nit sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . \ndetermined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . \nit is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . \nwhen lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . \nbut the joy in a film like this is in the little details . \nfor example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . \nif he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . \nit means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . \nit means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . \nhomer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . \nhere he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . \nthis is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . \nhe is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . \nbut he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . \nthrough coal-mining . \nbecause of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . \nthe revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . \nwe don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . \nthe paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . \nso _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . \nand this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . \nbtw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . \nanother commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago . \n'

aS'every year , hollywood crowns a new " it boy " --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom . \ninheriting the mantle from last year\'s " winner , " matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham\'s the rainmaker and good will hunting . \ndamon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola\'s take on the rainmaker . \ndamon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . \nwhile rudy\'s ( and the film\'s ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . \nwritten for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . \ncoppola\'s most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy\'s unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company\'s hotshot attorney ) . \nthe inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . \nthen , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy\'s often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . \nas good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . \ndamon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . \nin an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . \ngood will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon\'s intelligent script touches . \neven though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will\'s burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . \nthe material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . \nwilliams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will\'s best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will\'s harvard-schooled love interest . \nthe clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will\'s prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . \nso many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham\'s the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come . \n'

aS'synopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife . \nleonard has only a few clues to the murderer\'s identity ; to make matters worse , he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories , meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier . \nbecause of this , leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself . \n " memento " traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination . \nreview : " memento " is the sort of movie i wish i\'d written ; i can think of no higher praise than that . \ni am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant , involved , original movie as this . \nan instant film noir classic , " memento " is virtually flawless . \nthe script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity . \nalthough the idea of starting at the " conclusion " of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the " start " is not entirely new , never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence . \n " memento " is endlessly exciting and inventive , a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself , and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre . \nand it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively . \nnolan\'s direction is equally effective , never losing its crispness and clarity despite " memento " \'s challenging gimmick . \nand to top everything off , all the performances rise to the occasion . \npierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; and pantoliano\'s teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality . \n " memento " may be the year\'s best screenplay , and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001 . \n'

aS"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . \npeople who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . \nthe story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . \nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . \nshanta has a small circle of male admirers . \ntwo of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . \nthe others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . \n ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) \nin an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \nanother man is murdered . \nthe group of friends will not meet again . \nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \nthe story earth tells does not end . \nit just stops . \nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \nbut deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding . \n"

aS'up until about a year ago , john travolta\'s career consisted of those " look who\'s talking " movies ( notice how they never called them look who\'s talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . \nbut somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . \nweird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named " size isn\'t everything " ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . \nbut now travolta\'s back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . \nfour words : contract with the devil . \nand this has nothing to do with newt gingrich\'s " contract with america . " \nno , satan is much more humane . \nanyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . \nhow do i know ? \ni own the document in question . \namazing what you can buy at those collector\'s shops for a few hundred dollars , isn\'t it ? \nget shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . \nhe goes to collect some of the mafia\'s money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . \nsure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that\'s beside the point . \npalmer is determined to get hackman\'s next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . \nit doesn\'t take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from " who\'s the boss ? " \nto speechless . \nit works in this case , unlike " who\'s the boss ? " \nalthough it\'s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . \ncomplicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman\'s other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta\'s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . \nget shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . \nthis movie doesn\'t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i\'ve seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . \nget shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . \ni\'m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . \nare you getting this , shorty ? \n'

aS'i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . \nthis was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . \nnot only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . \nthe very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . \ngibson\'s performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . \ngibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . \nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . \ntry to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . \nif you can imagine that , then you\'ve basically got jerry fletcher . \nin many ways , i was surprised by this movie . \nto begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . \ndon\'t get me wrong , it\'s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . \nsecondly , i was surprised at mel gibson\'s performance . \nhe provided a fantastic performance . \nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . \ngibson\'s character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . \nfor instance , jerry\'s apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . \nand last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . \nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher\'s far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland\'s own opinions . \nmel gibson isn\'t the only stand-out in the film . \njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can\'t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . \nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her . \nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . \njerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . \nalthough he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . \nvery soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . \nafter barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . \nthe remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry\'s life being constantly put into jeopardy . \nand more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry\'s life . \nmany things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . \nfor instance , the meaning of the book " the catcher in the rye " and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . \nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . \nmake sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . \ndefinitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . \ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . \nand even if you aren\'t , you should still like this film . \n'

aS'the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it\'s hard to remember which one you\'re watching at any given moment . \n " mulan , " their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . \nonce again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . \nadd the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . \nbob\'s your uncle ! \nbetter make that walt\'s your uncle . . . \nkids will no doubt go ga-ga over " mulan " ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more . \nmaybe an animated feature without--shock ! \nhorror ! --the \nsongs , for example ? \nor maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ? \nhow about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ? \nit isn\'t gonna happen . \nlike disney\'s previous entries , " mulan " is slow to make its mark . \nthe animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy\'s animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought . \nhowever , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks . \nhighlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today\'s computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( " i\'ll make a man out of you , " penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself . \nvoiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney\'s strongest female character to date . \nwhen hordes of huns pour over china\'s great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace , the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army . \nsince mulan\'s father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited mulan steals her father\'s armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace . \nattracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d . \nwong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability . \nshe\'s a woman of the \'90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time . \n'

aS'disney\'s 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with , well , the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center . \ngreat wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can\'t quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack . \n ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy . \nsome lack lyrical snap . \nothers need more memorable melodies . \nboring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? ) \nso , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won\'t stay bored . \nthe highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let\'s get ready to rumble !

aS'the computer-animated comedy " shrek " is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . \nfor children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \nfor adults , it\'s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \nall in all , " shrek " is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \nbut first the basics . \nbased very loosely on a 1990 children\'s story , " shrek " follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \npetty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the " awk " in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \nhe proceeds to turn the ogre\'s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \nas a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \nan enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from " snow white " has shown him the way . \nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of " the dating game " ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , " even though she lives with seven men , she\'s not easy ! " ) \nfarquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . \nshrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . \nthey finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . \nfor the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . \nthe movie references a great many other flicks , from " babe " ( " that\'ll do , donkey . \nthat\'ll do " ) to " the graduate . " \nbut the lion\'s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \nthe public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a " possessed toy " and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , " get that dead broad off the table ! " \n ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad\'s royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like " it\'s a small world . " \nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one . \ni laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other\'s film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . \nhere\'s a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! \nput the past behind you ! \nthere\'s room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can\'t play nice , then go to your rooms ! \nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \nbeyond all the irreverence , " shrek " actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \nit\'s a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad\'s diminutive stature . \ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? \nthe pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . \nadding short jokes is simply mean . \nstill , " shrek " is a rollicking good time . \nthe computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . \nto trot out a clich ? , " shrek " is fun for all ages . \nparents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . \n'

aS'after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . \nthere is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . \n " you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , " he says , " then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , \'see you soon . \' " \nof course , it\'s meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . \nyou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . \nexperiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . \ntrust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . \njuzo itami\'s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . \na stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . \ngoro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . \ngoro finds that tampopo\'s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . \nthe problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . \nhowever , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . \nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . \ntake , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . \nthe price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . \ntampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . \nshe protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . \njust when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . \nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . \nthis scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . \nthere\'s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . \nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . \nthe scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . \nthere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people\'s lives . \na particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . \nsurrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . \nher husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . \nthe viewer knows the husband\'s intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . \nin a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . \nas the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . \npreparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . \nthen she falls over , dead . \nfor a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , " keep eating ! \nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ! " \ncrying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . \nthe scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . \nby including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . \ninstead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo\'s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . \nbecause the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the " good guys " come together for the final showdown . \nin this case , the showdown is against the ramen . \nif they eat tampopo\'s ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . \nit\'s pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack . \n'

aS"there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . \ngeorge lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . \nreturn of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films . \nthe dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . \ninstead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . \neven darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around . \nwith the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . \nreturn of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . \nluke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine . \ntheir goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt . \nit is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play . \nfrom a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch . \nas soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor . \nso , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks . \nthere , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader . \nreturn of the jedi has some interesting elements . \nthe scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted . \nfrom a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films . \nnot only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . \non one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . \nin the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch . \nthe acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . \nby now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas . \nthe chemistry amongst the trio is terrific . \nas in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . \nnewcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars . \nalthough it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment . \nwith the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang . \ncongratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come . \n , \n"

aS'why do so many children\'s films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? \ntoo many of those who write or direct for children\'s movies assume that the kids just can\'t handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . \n " the iron giant , " which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as " the simpsons " and " king of the hill , " assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . \n " the iron giant " holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that\'s enjoyable for both children and adults alike . \nhogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . \nafter staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . \nhe comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . \nafter saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . \nbecause of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . \nrealizing he can\'t just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . \nit soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can\'t keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . \nhe suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth\'s house as a lodger . \nmeanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . \n " the iron giant " is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn\' t talk down to its audience . \nthe story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . \nit\'s very similar to the spielberg classic " e . t . , \' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of " the iron giant . " \nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielberg\'s film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . \nthe film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one\'s ability to choose one\'s own fate . \nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . \nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won\'t give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . \nthe animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after " tarzan " ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you\'re watching a cartoon . \nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \nthe characters\' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv\'s " frasier " ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn\'t ditched ) . \ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won\'t mind , but " the iron giant " has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \nthe film isn\'t only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \nit\'s also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on " the simpsons " for many years . \na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to " outlast " one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \nthe film even takes some jabs at america\'s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to " duck and cover " in the event of a nuclear attack . \n " the iron giant " has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \nwhen you get right down to it , " the iron giant " is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \nit\'s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it\'s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which " the iron giant " has in spades . \n'

aS'susan granger\'s review of " the closet " ( miramax films ) \nin this hilarious french farce , a shy , boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovers he\'s going to be fired from his job at a condom factory . \nlonely and distraught , he contemplates suicide . \nbut then he runs into belone ( michel aumont ) , an elderly homosexual neighbor , who suggests a " sex discrimination " lawsuit to intimidate management . \nas evidence , belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon\'s boss . \nwhen the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory , not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man . \nhis lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that she wonders if , perhaps , she could change his sexual preferences . \neven his ex-wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevillen ) drop their disdain . \nbut not everyone is enchanted . \na mucho macho co-worker felix ( gerard depardieu ) , a self-righteous homophobe , is stunned and repulsed when he\'s forced by the pr director ( thierry lhermite ) to grovel and court pignon\'s friendship or risk losing his own job . \nwriter/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness , veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia . \ndaniel auteuil ( " the widow of saint-pierre " ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head , riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the closet " is a frankly sexual , adult 8 . \nit\'s so clever , in fact , that hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english , like " la cage aux folles .

aS'roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor . \nhowever the emperor\'s evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed . \nmaximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) . \nproximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator . \nwhen emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle . \nmaximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus . \ngladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required " 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence " style of moviemaking . \nthe only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . . \nit\'s choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting . \nit\'s similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective . \nthe actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed . \nmany times it\'s unclear as to exactly what\'s going on . . . \nall the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled . \nwe\'re not sure who\'s blood or by who\'s hand though . \nthere\'s an instance of this earlier in the film too that\'s disappointing . \nit\'s comes when maximus escapes his executioners . \nsome flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . . \nbut i still don\'t know exactly how he did it . \nrussell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995\'s virtuosity . \nfor whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . . \nbut he should have it now . \nfrom here on moviegoers should now be able to say , " let\'s go see the new russell crowe movie " . \nhe gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum . \nit\'s both rousing and chilling . \njoaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened ) . \ncommodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly . \nit\'s a very good ( and very creepy ) performance . \noliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it\'s a huge loss to the acting world . \ni\'ve always been fascinated with reed . . . \nhe\'s one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years . \nit\'s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance . \nthe film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed . \nreed\'s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed . \nrather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars . \nironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film . \nanyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren\'t looking for it you won\'t even be able to tell . \nsome of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . . \nand like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately . \nit\'s sad that such a good film has these distractions . \nmovies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects . \nkeep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events , but is entirely a work of fiction . \nhowever it\'s a work of fiction that\'s great entertainment , and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d . \n'

aS'what a great film . \nwhat a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming , life-affirming , miraculous film . \n>from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy . \na car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way . \nthey mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day . \nheil ! \nheil ! \nhuh ? \nshortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces . \nthis is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives . \ngranted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece . \ni think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character . \nbenigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race . \nbenigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept . \nit = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema . \nthere are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly . \nslapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed . \nand although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in . \nthis is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family . \nthe second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported . \nguido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child . \nfor = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right . \nfor his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds . \nwhich raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ? \nwith persecution ? \nwith injustice on the worst level ? \nit+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not realize they had . \nother times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim . \nsometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds . \nbenigni+s guido realizes this . \nhe is the clown , but he is not a fool . \nhe sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh . \nhis liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him . \nit+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor . \nperhaps that is a form of denial . \nperhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) . \nor . . . \nperhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit . \nwhatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept . \nsurprisingly , it works . \nit is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust . \nit+s not that the atrocities are trivialized , far from it . \nthey don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more . \ni believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone , and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing . \nhowever , any criticism that this is rewriting history , that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off-target . \nbenigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) . \nhe has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society . \nit swept the italian academy awards . \ncontroversy notwithstanding , it is one of the great films this year , and as of this writing , the one to beat for best film . \nmasterful . \nmiraculous . \na must-see . \n'

aS'ingredients : starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood \nsynopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel . \nin the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham\'s snobbish adopted daughter , estella . \nthe gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class " gentleman . " \npip leaves for london with " great expectations " to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella . \nbut life has a way of complicating things . \npip becomes an arrogant s . o . b . \nuntil he learns just who his secret benefactor is . \nin this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) . \nbut soon the focus of finn\'s life becomes romance , as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment . \nestella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , an eccentric , aged and embittered , man-hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage . \nthis causes estella to \'fear the daylight\' of relationships , but finn thinks it\'s just a case of snobbery . \nwhen finn becomes a young man , an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist . \nfinn leaves florida with " great expectations " to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella . \nwhat will happen to all of finn\'s " great expectations ? " \nopinion : if you\'re looking for a romance with a happy ending , look no further ; you\'ve found one here . \nethan hawke is romantic lead . \n ( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites . \nhe romanced julie delpy in before sunrise . \nhe romanced uma thurman in gattaca . \nnow in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail-thin blonde . ) \nhawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film . \nmeanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella\'s whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate . \nanne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor , while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably . \nthe difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love , whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease . \n'

aS"you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . \nthe difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care . \nthe hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . \nthe seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . \ndesperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . \nthe preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . \nonly after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . \nmalcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . \nhe will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . \nthe sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . \n ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) \nit's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . \ncole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . \nperhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old . \nthat's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . \nwe appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . \nboth actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . \nwillis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . \nosment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . \nthe sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . \nonly because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours . \nthe story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . \ni'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity . \n"

aS'hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) . \nit\'s a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters . \ni mean , come on . \nare people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? \nhell no . \nand not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films . \nand not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk \'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either . \nthis is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu . \ni got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays . \nand that is exactly what this film is ; art . \ni\'ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers . \nlet me backtrack a minute . \nwhen i say " intellectual ground " , i don\'t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved . \nwith most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown . \nthose movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen . \nyou see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore . \nthis is a thinking man\'s slasher flick . \nthe " nosferatu " of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy . \nhe employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) . \nupon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock\'s castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter\'s ) . \nthe next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not \nreally a good sign . \nhe then discovers through some reading that the count is a " nosferatu " , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans . \nbut by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter\'s hometown via boat . \nwill hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? \nthe character of orlock is , of course , dracula . \nthe only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker\'s novel . \njust thought that was an interesting little side note . . . \nprobably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment\'s digitally restored cut , now available in stores . \nhowever , this version is quite different than maunau\'s original masterpiece . \nthe movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang\'s metropolis . \nnow , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one . \nbut alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen . \nbut that\'s just my bag ; you may like the newer , more " modern " version better . \neither way , i suggest investing your money in a copy . \nif you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy . \nif you\'re like me , just do what i\'ll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made . \n'

aS"stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . \ngrim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento . \nboasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . \nit follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's . \nbased on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . \nvisiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . \nat the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . \nposing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . \na gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives . \nthe stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . \nit is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration . \nthe script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . \nbut as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . \nargento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . \neffects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . \nthe film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . \nproof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers . \nthe cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . \nasia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . \nit's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . \nthomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . \nbut perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack . \nactive since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . \nit's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . \nit's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . \nthis is a long welcome reunion . \nif the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax . \nbut by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career . \n * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can . \ndubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web . \n"

aS'close your eyes for a moment , if you will , and imagine the sound of stephen rea\'s gaelic brogue , silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness . \na lackadaisical , naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols . \nan acerbic , sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess\' " a clockwork orange . " \na voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile , like those out of " delicatessen , " or " the tin drum . " \nimagine all of that , and you\'ll get a good sense of what you can expect from " the butcher boy . " \nimagine that and more . \nneil jordan\'s latest film " stars " rea in more ways than one . \nrea , the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan\'s " the crying game , " contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s . \nbut it\'s his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title , da brady\'s son , francis , that makes rea\'s " performance " worth watching , worth listening to . \nand that\'s only half the fun . \nplaying the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is , without a doubt , a revelation . \nfor as much as rea\'s voiceover permeates almost every scene of " the butcher boy , " owens commands virtually every frame . \nit\'s impossible to take your eyes off him . \nwith his crop of carrot-colored hair , ruddy complexion , and overall grubby appearance , francie brady is an unlikely hero , refusing to be done in by his alcoholic , trumpet-playing father , his depressive , suicidal mother , or the neighboring , bespectacled monster known as mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . \nin fact , everything was ok until " the nugent " came to town . \nnow , she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace ( " the butcher boy " is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many ) . \n " pigs ! " screams mrs . nugent at the brady menagerie . \n " you\'re all pigs ! " \nit\'s the start of many a related image . \nafter ma brady is shipped off to the " garage " for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many , francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians , the lone ranger , and other comicbook characters . \nsquealing like a stuck pig , francie does " the likes o\' that " on the nugent\'s living room floor , and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for " boney arsed bogmen , " where his ever fertile imagination--and clever chicanery--runneth over . \ndirector jordan\'s vivid treatment of pat mccabe\'s nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing , dark comedy littered with surreal touches ( such as sin ? ad o\'connor playing the virgin mary ) . \nit\'s not as outlandish as the trailers make out ; instead , this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys ( schoolboy chums in real life ) , allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior . \nit\'s bleak and it\'s black but it\'s fundamentally very funny . \nrea talks us through it , beautifully , and owens drags us though it , admirably , and , in tandem with jordan\'s sure hand , theirs are contributions to make " the butcher boy " a film worth savoring . \n'

aS'zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don\'t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . \nzero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he\'d like to think so ) . \nhowever , he\'s a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . \nzero\'s accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a " normal " guy who does the business side of the job -- he\'s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero\'s greatness as an investigator . \nthe opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero\'s talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o\'neal ) . \nit turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . \nzero takes the case , and the plot thickens . \nhis path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . \ndespite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . \nthrough his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . \ni have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . \ni can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown\'s greatness ) . \nzero effect , which is jake kasdan\'s first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it\'s an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . \nwith so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . \nbut he didn\'t just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . \ntake , for starters , the great cast of characters . \npullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven\'t seen from him since spaceballs . \nzero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he\'s an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . \npullman\'s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he\'s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . \nben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he\'s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \n " i\'ll shoot you , " he says to stark at one point . \n " i have a gun , and everything . " \nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \no\'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \nkasdan\'s humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \nit\'s the kind of humor that\'s funny even after you\'ve seen it five or six times . \nthere\'s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \ni can\'t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \nas a side note , i don\'t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \ni have a feeling the humor here won\'t appeal to everyone , but there\'s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone\'s interest . \njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can\'t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \nzero effect is the kind of film that i\'ll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \nand , with kasdan\'s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \n'

aS'the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed . \neven pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets . \nhowever , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin . \ndavis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years . \nwith the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative . \nneedless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory . \nshane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i\'m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it\'s worth , it delivers the goods . \nlike black\'s previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue . \nthe humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously . \nbut there\'s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . . \nwhile ice skating ? \njackson and davis make a good team . \njackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction . \nas good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine . \nwhat makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn\'t take herself too seriously . \nshe is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation . \nthis is not to say that she doesn\'t need work--sometimes she lays on the " toughness " a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature . \nbut should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche . \nit seems as if davis and harlin\'s first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride . \nanyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss . \n'

aS"screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . \nscreenplay by andrew kevin walker . \ninspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . \ndirected by tim burton . \nstarring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . \nspecial appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . \nsynopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . \ntownspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . \ncute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . \ncomments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . \nbatman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . \nhe's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . \nsleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . \nsleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . \nchristopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . \nthe movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . \none of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . \ni mention these allusions for a reason . \nseasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . \nwith the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . \nnot only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . \nthe film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . \njohnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator . \ndepp is adequate in his role . \nno more ; no less . \nequally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . \nshe's a good witch too . \nhow cute . \none of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . \nthe two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . \nveteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . \nwhile i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . \nyou have to pay attention . \nandrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . \nhe's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . \nwalker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation . \nas one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . \nthere's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . \nthis is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . \na lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand . \nhe was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence . \nif you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended . \n"

aS'mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest " hot properties " in action adventure stardom , and it\'s just about time . \nfor over twenty-five years , jackie\'s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \n " drunken master " has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to " make it big " --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \ni\'m not entirely sure why , exactly . \nin many ways , " drunken master " is similar to most of jackie\'s other early films , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii , " master with cracked fingers " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , " spiritual kung fu " , and others . \nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \nthey\'re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \n " drunken master " , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \n ( as an aside , " drunken master " was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \nat the time , i didn\'t really think it was anything special . . . but \nafter having seen more films like it , it\'s kind of grown on me . ) \n " drunken master " \'s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii and " master with cracked fingers " --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been " adapted , " to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka " naughty panther , " a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \nafter embarrassing his instructor\'s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \nthen , when he\'s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \n " drunken master " features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \nit\'s been said before , but i\'ll say it again--these fights don\'t just _happen_ , they\'re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \nwhether jackie wins or loses , it\'s really something to see . . . and \nit\'s often as funny as anything , too . \nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \nthere\'s very little that\'s new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \nbut they\'re still hilarious as ever . \nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they\'re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \nthe really big thing about " drunken master " , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \ni\'m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \nit apparently helps if you\'re drunk while you\'re doing it . \ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there\'s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what\'s going on . \ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film\'s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it\'s \nnot just martial arts , it\'s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , " whoa . . . " \non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \n " gone with the wind " , this isn\'t . \nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you\'ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \nit\'s much more " real " than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \nyou might very well like it . \nanother interesting thing about " drunken master " has to do with its video availability in the us . \n " drunken master " is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \nthankfully , " drunken master " , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \nif you like " drunken master " , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren\'t really _too_ bad . . . if \nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \ni particularly recommend " spiritual kung fu " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , the " fearless hyena " movies , and " snake & crane arts of shaolin " . \nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , " drunken master ii " , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i\'ve been told to suggest the " once upon a time in china " series starring jet li ( though i haven\'t personally seen any of them yet ) . \nif you choose to watch " drunken master " , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that\'s out there . \nall in all , i give this film an . \n'

aS'logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . \nconsidering that the skeptic\'s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . \noccasionally , we get a film that does manage it . \nterry gilliam\'s " 12 monkeys " was one such film . \nbut more frequently , we get films that don\'t much deal with it at all . \nthere is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? \nthe " terminator " films made up for them with exciting action , " back to the future " did it with an entertaining story , and the new film " frequency " pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . \nis " frequency " filled with plot holes ? \nyes . \ndoes it matter ? \nnot really . \nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \'69 and that john has found in the present day . \nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \nthe premise of " frequency " is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \nthis isn\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \nwhen frank doesn\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \nsometimes frank\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\'t really the point . \nwhen " frequency " gets cooking , it\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and " frequency " works as long as it keeps moving . \nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure " frequency " as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\'s face it : it\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in " frequency " to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \nthe other major thing to appreciate about " frequency " is the handling of the father-son relationship . \nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\'t believe in the characters , we don\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \nandre braugher , late of the television show " homicide : life on the street , " gives a nice supporting turn as frank\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \nperhaps the only thing i didn\'t like about " frequency " is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \nbut that\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \ni freely acknowledge that " frequency " may best work as a " guy " movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of " field of dreams " can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \nwho wouldn\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \nor see how their children turn out ? \n " tell me about your life , son " -- excuse me while i mist up . \nand don\'t call me a sissy . \n'

aS"blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men . \nblade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . \nit is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . \nalthough , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . \nthe ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . \nbut at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . \nthat really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . \nblade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . \nhis mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . \nincluding a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . \nblade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . \nbut this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . \nthe government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . \nwhere do vampires get money ? \nwell , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . \ni personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . \nblade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . \nhe isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . \nhe has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . \nit's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire . \nadmittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . \nthe story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . \nthe acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . \nthis isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . \nthe movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . \nit's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . \nblade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . \nalthough , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . \nblade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . \nthis is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . \nwhat blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . \nvery cool . \n"

aS'the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey\'s dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen . \nin case you\'ve been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven . \nhis life seems so perfect , however , because it\'s controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of . \nthat\'s right , burbank\'s life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it\'s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . \nthe film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . \nwith an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . \nluckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . \ntalking of carrey , he\'s perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . \nhis character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey\'s persona . \nhe occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey . \nhe\'s not completely dramatic like the film promises , however . \ned harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show . \nquiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer . \nunfortunately , he\'s barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen\'t appear at all ! \nalso disappointing is natascha mcelhone\'s character sylvia . \nshe plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her . \nthe supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it\'s creepy . \nthe philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film . \npeter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun . \nthe film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card . \nalthough it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll . \nsadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam . \nalso , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing . \nthe screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim . \nwhile christoff\'s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do . \nalso , there\'s some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show . \noverall , the truman show is excellent entertainment . \ncertainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone . \nit offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed . \noverall rating= \nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \n " you know , for kids " - norville barnes \n'

aS'no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan\'s harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe\'s novel about young lad francie brady\'s ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland . \non one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie\'s story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . \non another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie\'s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o\'sullivan ) . \non yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , " bad " deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them . \nhowever , the butcher boy\'s power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing . \nwhat makes it so unsettling is the francie\'s overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) . \nthink heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you\'ll sort of understand . \nanchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens . \nthe butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable . \nin the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , " that movie was so unfunny !

aS"just how inseparable is the team of sgt . \nmartin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt . \nroger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ? \nlet's just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it ! \nthe familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye . \nnew to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective . \ntrouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception . \neven when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship . \nwe here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen . \ngunfire ensues , and when it's all over , the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord . \nalthough they don't know what they're looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action . \nand there's plenty of action here for two movies . \nled by fighting sensation jet li , whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive , he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to . \nli is ruthless in his approach , will kill anyone just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives . \nthere are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore . \nit's a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun . \nbut even too many explosions can get boring . \nto counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li . \nluckily , he'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns . \nmeanwhile , when the detectives aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets . \neverybody gets in on the shtick . \nrusso screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones . \ngibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano . \nscore one for the old guard . \n"

aS'since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993\'s schindler\'s list shows . \nmost of today\'s mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \nthat\'s why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol\' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950\'s company town of coalwood , west virginia . \nit\'s a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \nthe mine , which is run by homer\'s father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , " anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . " \ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he\'s doing here . \nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film\'s charm . \nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer\'s mother and father . \nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \nher role is instantly likeable . \nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer\'s father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \nhe\'s definitely a driving force in homer\'s life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys\' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \nalthough it doesn\'t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she\'s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \nit\'s a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \n'

aS'a big surprise to me . \nthe good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . \nthey replaced him just fine . \nnot with john goodman , he didn\'t do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . \nthe fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who\'s ten . \nthis was another of my fears for the film , but he\'s a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) . \nthings that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . \ni\'m quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . \nthere\'s a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops . \nit\'s just the music . \none of my problems with the first is that cab calloway\'s song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there\'s no problems with this . \nthe music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can\'t sing , all the musicians do a great job . \nthe only real problems i had was the special effects . \nthese were superfluous and a waste of money . \nsince the film isn\'t doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see . \nthe bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide . \n-- http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/academy/8034/ \nremove no spam to reply . \n " drive carefully but recklessly " , mama , child\'s toy " the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise .

aS'after having heard so many critics describe " return to me " as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \nwhat made " return to me " old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \nthe charisma of the two leads ? \neven now i can\'t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven\'t see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \ni don\'t think any of the romances i\'ve seen have been classified as such . \nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- " return to me " was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \nit was traditional , magical . \nwe knew it couldn\'t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn\'t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt\'s direction . \nfrom the very first bird\'s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the " return to me " ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we\'re in for something sweet . \nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \nreal people don\'t act that way ; real people aren\'t that nice . \nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks\' existence . \nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt\'s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob\'s wardrobes . \nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \n " return to me " has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we\'re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \ndisappointingly , david alan grier\'s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of " the x-files . " \nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \nwhile " return to me " functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife\'s heart . \nwe already know that there\'s going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she\'s supposed to have his ex-wife\'s heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \nhowever , in the spirit of " return to me , " it won\'t do to be too picky about how " old " hollywood tells its stories . \ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \nit shows . \nthe bottom line : " return to me " is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn\'t imagined . \n'

aS"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal . \nthe setting of the film is a town named blue bay . \nit consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors . \nthe film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school . \nit is here that we meet all of the core characters . \nthere's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan . \nwe first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly . \nthroughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape . \nshortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well . \nthis pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted . \nduring the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her . \nhowever , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor . \nafter sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her . \nit is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together . \nit is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda . \nmatt dillon stars as sam lombardo . \nsam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage . \nhe isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance . \nhowever , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place . \nneve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller . \nsuzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film . \ncampbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch . \nplaying kelly van ryan is denise richards . \nkelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra . \none of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother . \ndenise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film . \nin the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well . \nkevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette . \nthis character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film . \nhowever , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story . \nstill , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name . \nin the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden . \nhats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film . \nalthough wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters . \nthis is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists . \n"

aS' * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * * \nthe previous two " alien " films have each had their own unique styles to them . \nthe ridley scott\'s alien was very much a stylistic suspense film . \njames cameron\'s aliens was much more of an action film . \nand i liked each film separately for which it was . \nnow alien 3 is out . \nand it is it\'s own film in the same right that alien and aliens were . \nunlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens . \nthis is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off . \nthe survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens . \nthe climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg . \nin the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel . \nthis vessel crash lands on fury 109 . \neveryone in the vessel is killed , except ripley . \nthe facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash . \nfury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison . \nwhen closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet . \nall the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years . \nripley\'s arrival sparks a problem with the inmates . \nas for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner\'s sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet . \nbeing an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons . \nso the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own . \ni will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here . \nthe alien is loose and no one believes ripley\'s outstanding story . \nshe finds comfort in the arms of the colony\'s doctor . \nyes , after 57 years ripley has sex . \nit is not gratuitous , in fact , we don\'t even see them kiss , but it is just as well . \na sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film . \nthere is a lot more gore in alien 3 . \nin fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two . \nit also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! \ni won\'t say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 . \nsigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character . \nher scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination . \nthe rest of the cast is also quite good . \nnotably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 . \nalien 3 has a very distinct look . \nthis is due largely to its director , david fincher . \nmr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here . \nhis direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no " alien " film has before . \nfor mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him . \nthe music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry . \nelliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the " alien " series been set in . \nthis time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner\'s aliens ) . \nthis score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring . \nthis is a great score . \nthe ending to alien 3 is quite good . \nthere were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely . \ni will not ruin the ending for you . \ngo see the film . \ni consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season . \nalien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien . \nand when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in . \n'

aS"are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ? \nwafflemovies . com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves . \neveryweek , wafflemovies . com \nreviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video . \nhere is a sample review : \nwelcome to sarajevo \nin light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years . \nset in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war . \nthe picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding . \nas they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride . \nyet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war . \nin this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church . \njoe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know . \nhis fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) . \nmichael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest . \nhenderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread . \nhe decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth . \nhenderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines . \nhe finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult . \nduring his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner . \nhe promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance . \nafter the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope . \nhowever , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans . \nunfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england . \nthe group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy . \ncan they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ? \nthe movie was beautifully and sensitively made . \ndirector michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred . \nthey show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with . \nthis is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended . \nthe group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities . \none of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth . \nlike the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live . \nwinterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room . \nthe picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics . \nwinterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities . \nthis portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com \nselection mad city . \nwe watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached . \nhowever , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out . \nstephen dillane is wonderful as henderson . \nhe portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events . \ndillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy . \nhenderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few . \nit is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea . \nwoody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation . \nharrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through . \nharrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one . \nthis ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career . \namerica's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place . \nfor those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson . \nwar is a foreign concept to most of us in america . \nbattles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to . \ntelevised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war . \nthis picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america . \n"

aS'many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . \nwhile possibly shallow , i\'ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . \nthere is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . \nstephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . \nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . \neven the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . \nin the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . \ncamille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . \nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . \nlike stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . \nwhen stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . \nhowever , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . \nstephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . \nas the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . \nthese two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . \nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . \nhowever , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . \nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . \nhowever , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . \nconsequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . \nin contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . \nhowever , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world\'s finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . \nduring the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . \nstephane attempts to remain unchanged . \nhowever , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . \none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . \nthe development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . \namerican movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . \nin its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . \nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille\'s and stepahne\'s characters . \ni am not sure why berardinelli says , " at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil\'s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . " \nthis movie is not about judging stephane\'s actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . \ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \nthis portion of the film is where the " sense of closure " could have been successfully accomplished . \nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \nthe synergism of the tension of ravel\'s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \nemmanuelle beart\'s personality is beautiful . \nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \n'

' \nand what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? \nperhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . \nif that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . \nwhen he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . \ncarol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . \nshe is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . \nthis , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . \nhenry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . \nhenry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . \nmeanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life . \nwayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . \nhowever , his lack of commitment threatens their success . \nthe heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . \n`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . \nnewman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff . \nhe possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . \nfiorentino is also a fun presence . \nyou root for her despite her sense of amorality . \nsure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . \nwith two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is . \n"

aS"robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood . \npaul newman stars as retired detective harry ross . \nharry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight . \nwhen jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in . \nsoon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust . \nthere are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon . \njames garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends . \nstockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest . \nreese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend . \ngiancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain . \nwith a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze . \nluckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony . \ntwilight has a solid film noir-ish plot . \nit may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days . \nthe major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber . \nhowever , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable . \nthe supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn . \nstockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher . \nthere's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe . \nit's a minor , but irritating , flaw . \nwith a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight . \nit's biggest flaw is actually its short running time . \nat a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package . \nstill , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two . \n"

aS"warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had better avoid this film . \nor lots of blood & guts , men against men and mano-et-mano stuff . \nin other words , it's a walter hill film ! \nwith a john milius script ! \ni always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches . \nthese films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb . \nand we got tough guys galore , here ; drug-running banditos by the dozens , all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered , overall ; a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ; and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers who'd as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you . \nin particular , we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger , powers boothe as the drug kingpin , michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army , and rip torn as the local sheriff . \ntorn is the sympathetic figure of the group ; he smiles before shooting anyone . \nas to women . . . \nwell , i've never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film , and at this rate , i doubt i ever will . \nwomen exist here to look good , comfort the man , and get argued over . \ngosh ! \njust like the old days . . . \nfrankly , this is a pretty good movie , if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff . \nthe cinematography is excellent , the cast of characters is broad and has texture , the script is quite good , and the film lets you keep up with what's happening yourself , without spelling it out to you . \ni appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up . \nfinally , there's lots of sam peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups . \n"

aS"accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . \none could almost say the same about his much-prized film . \nrarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . \nin short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . \nyet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . \nralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . \nbut despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . \nhis emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . \nthe same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . \njuliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . \nat least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . \neven this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . \nwith so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing . \nyet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air . \nhints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . \nthere is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . \nbut ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . \nin the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . \nbore is perhaps too strong a word . \nbut after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . \n"

aS'a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins . \nit is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie " fingers " coyle ( mitchum ) . \nhe got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment . \nhis current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn\'t think he could survive prison at his age . \nhe is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare . \nhe could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that . \nhe is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) . \nthe masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager\'s house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it . \non one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm . \ncoyle\'s best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender . \nhe is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs . \nwith the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time . \nhe contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain . \nthinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence . \nbut foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer . \nwarning : spoiler follows in next paragraph . \nthe bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend . \nthe contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up . \ncoyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , " to be young like that and have his future , he\'s the greatest hockey player in the world . " \ndillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston . \nthis is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next . \nthe city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder . \nthere is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat . \nmitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot . \nit makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them . \nmitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor . \nbut in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle . \n'

aS' " footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics . \nand i hate to admit it ; i fell for it . \nthe movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . \nhe ends up falling for the preacher\'s daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . \nas mentioned at the beginning of this review , " footloose " is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama . \nthere are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate . \nso why did i enjoy it so much ? \nfor one thing , the cast is great . \nkevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role . \nwe\'re rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn\'t play him as the " rebel without a clue " sort . \nyes , he does rebel , but he\'s also polite when he needs to be . \nand he never broods . \nthe rest of the cast is equally impressive . \njohn lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian . \nbut lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter . \nby the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character . \nanother nice touch is the music . \nwe see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with " sexual innuendos " , but that\'s not true at all . \nthe title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun . \nduring the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing . \nof course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic . \nanyway , " footloose " is a charming little surprise . \ndon\'t let the premise prevent you from watching it . \nit sucked me in , and it\'ll do the same to you . \n'

aS'as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . \nwith the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a " great " piece of work and viceversa . \nattempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . \ni avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . \nas the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . \nas such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . \ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . \ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . \nit is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . \nall the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . \nthe classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . \nit is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . \nthe elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . \nthe paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . \nthe fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . \nthere need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . \nas in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . \ndo not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . \nfor those who are put off by the " art " label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . \nthere are no weak performances in this movie . \nmichelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . \nchow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . \nzhang ziyi is a budding superstar . \nshe is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . \ncheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . \nkudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . \nang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . \nthis is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . \ndon\'t miss it . \n'

aS' " crazy/beautiful " suffers from the damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don\'t syndrome . \nafter a spate of flighty , cookie-cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story . \nbut rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown " afterschool special . " \neven worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to " tone things down . " \nneedless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated . \n " we were trying to make a cautionary tale , " he told newsweek , " and we couldn\'t show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from . " \nregardless , the film works , thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes . \n " crazy/beautiful " is quality fare , good enough that i half-expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for " failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes . " \nset in pacific palisades , calif . , the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens . \nevery morning and evening , carlos nunez ( jay hernandez ) takes a two-hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school . \nan honor student and star athlete , carlos is responsible , modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy . \nall is well until he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) . \nnicole is a drunk apparently hell-bent on self-destruction . \ncarlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her , but he is only human and she has the greatest smile . \nplus , as her father notes , she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral . \nas with " save the last dance , " " crazy/beautiful " ( god , how i hate lower-case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh . \nwhile noting the racial and social differences between the kids , the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s ( there are still several mtv moments , though ) . \nthe filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there . \ncute-as-a-button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole\'s behavior . \nshe is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down , i hoped the boy would listen . \nas carlos , hernandez is a revelation . \nhunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team , the young man can really act ; we will see a lot of this guy in the future . \naside from its title , the biggest problem with " crazy/beautiful " is its ending , which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy . \nafter carefully presenting credible characters and situations , the conclusion feels rushed and lazy . \nstill , this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots . \n " afterschool special " my ass ? " crazy/beautiful " is the real deal . \n'

aS'everyone knows someone like giles de\'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with " progress . " \ngiles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . \nhis house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he\'s living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . \nthis is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns " erstwhile fogy " giles into a three-dimensional human being . \ndespite his tunnel vision , it\'s impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love . \nand , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it\'s possible to find the object of one\'s affection in the most unusual places . \ngiles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . \nwhat he doesn\'t realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . \na nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . \njust as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it\'s love at first sight . \ngiles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . \n ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn\'t realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . ) \neventually , not satisfied with being the world\'s foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol\'s home is located . \nbostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie\'s supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . \neventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles\' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man\'s advice . \nbut , while giles\' affection runs deep , ronnie\'s feelings are less constant . \nlove and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . \nin fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect . \nit suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . \nin his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target . \nin the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited . \nfrom start to finish , this is clearly hurt\'s movie ? he\'s in almost every frame . \nit\'s a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions . \njason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . \nhe is charismatic , and it\'s not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie . \nmeanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin . \nlove and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a " fish out of water " tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . \nyet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . \nit has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile . \n'

" , he knows his second book has to be better than his first . \ninstead of finding out , he drifts , comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood . \nhe doesn\'t have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer ( tobey maguire ) . \njames may be suicidal and psychotic . \ncertainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie . \nhe makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn\'t interesting enough . \nas the weekend progresses , they are both forced to fully engage life . \nthat\'s the question they must face : comfort or real experiences ? \nthe film takes some interesting chances . \nnon-traditional relationships are presented as matter-of-fact . \nextra-marital , gay , interracial , professor-student : here they aren\'t judged , merely choices . \nthe actors are all first-rate . \ndouglas triumphs , playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled , unshaven and clad in a pink women\'s house robe . \nmaguire\'s disengaged alienation works perfectly here . \nrobert downey jr . as grady\'s agent livens up his scenes . \ndirector curtis hanson ( " l . a . \nconfidential " ) makes a few missteps . \nthe women are underused . \nfrances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara , grady\'s married lover but we never understand much of who she is . \nthe chemistry between the two of them is non-existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing . \nkatie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor , but her character goes nowhere . \nwe never even see grady\'s exiting wife . \nthis is very much a guy\'s film . \nthe varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others . \ngrady\'s alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film , not him and sara . \nas the boomers age , expect to see more mid-life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic . \neventually it\'ll probably become cliche , but right now we\'ve got a winner . \ni\'ll finish this in a second . \nright now i have to grab some paint . \ni noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch-up . \n ( michael redman has written this column for so long that he\'s made mid-life crisis a career choice . ) \n'

aS'meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 ) \nstarring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani \nin " meet joe black " , brad pitt plays death . \nthat\'s all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description . \ndeath decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it\'s like to be human . \ndeath assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues . \nfor one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani . \nobviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ? \nbesides eternal damnation , of course . \nthere is also a sub-plot about forlani\'s ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company . \n " meet joe black " runs just under three hours . \ni\'ve always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics . \n " meet joe black " is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be . \nevery single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long . \nand the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should . \na severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is . \npitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death . \ni believed his performance , and i could see why forlani\'s character would fall in love with him . \ni have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that\'s been around for all time wouldn\'t know what peanut butter was . \nthat has nothing to do with pitt\'s performance , of course , but it is a little distracting . \nhopkins gives his usual excellent performance . \nhe\'s able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner . \nand in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good . \nshe has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her . \nso , " meet joe black " is a good movie hampered by it\'s ridiculous running time . \nhad the film been cut by an hour or so , i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review . \n'

aS'call it touched by a demon . \ngregory hoblit\'s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \nin fact , there\'s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion\'s share of the weirdness distilled out . \n ( remember bob ? ) \nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it\'s consistently interesting , it\'s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , " what goes around really goes around . " \nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing " time is on my side " as he\'s taken on his last walk . \nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn\'t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \nand , with reese\'s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they\'re up against . \nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes\' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don\'t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\'s geno\'s steaks . \nshadows and night scenes abound . \nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \nthis is the kind of setting where it\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \nfallen\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \nwashington\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \nit\'s not that he\'s bad per se , but he\'s not very interesting . \nthere\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \nwashington\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \nthat said , however , there\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\'s or sutherland\'s work . \nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like " i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself " become a little hard to swallow . \nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \nhowever , despite the negatives , i\'m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \nit\'s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it\'s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \nand , whatever you do , don\'t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \n'

aS'plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . \nthey get into an accident . \none of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . \nwhat\'s the deal ? \nwatch the movie and " sorta " find out . . . \ncritique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn\'t snag this one correctly . \nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \nso what are the problems with the movie ? \nwell , its main problem is that it\'s simply too jumbled . \nit starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what\'s going on . \nthere are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \nnow i personally don\'t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film\'s biggest problem . \nit\'s obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \nand do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \nnot really . \nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn\'t the make the film all that more entertaining . \ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is " into it " even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \nokay , we get it . . . there \nare people chasing her and we don\'t know who they are . \ndo we really need to see it over and over again ? \nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \napparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \nthere might\'ve been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess " the suits " decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \nthe actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character\'s unraveling . \noverall , the film doesn\'t stick because it doesn\'t entertain , it\'s confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \noh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it\'s \njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \nwhatever . . . skip \nit ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \na nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - stir of echoes ( 8/10 ) \n'

aS'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \ndamn that y2k bug . \nit\'s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . \nlittle do they know the power within . . . \ngoing for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . \nwe don\'t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don\'t know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don\'t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . \nhere , it\'s just " hey , let\'s chase these people around with some robots " . \nthe acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . \nyou\'re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . \nsutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he\'s acting like a baldwin , of course . \nthe real star here are stan winston\'s robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone\'s brain . \nso , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here\'s your movie . \notherwise , it\'s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . \n'

aS"it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . \nbased on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . \nhowever , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . \nof course , the ads make it seem like so much more . \nquick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . \nsounds like a cool movie , does it not ? \nafter the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . \nthe mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough . \nthe film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . \nand with it comes every single clich ? . \nit doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . \nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . \nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . \nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . \nunfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time . \nwith the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . \ndespite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . \ninformation on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . \nthe way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . \nbasing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . \nthe number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . \nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late . \navoid this film at all costs . \n"

aS' " quest for camelot " is warner bros . \' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney\'s cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . \nthe only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall\'s promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production " anastasia , " but disney\'s " hercules , " with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997\'s best piece of animation . \nthis year , it\'s no contest , as " quest for camelot " is pretty much dead on arrival . \neven the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that\'d be " pocahontas " for those of you keeping score -- isn\'t nearly as dull as this . \nthe story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur\'s round table . \nkayley\'s only dream is to follow in her father\'s footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur\'s magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . \nwith the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that\'s always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur\'s side . \n " quest for camelot " is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it\'s ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . \nthere\'s nothing here that differentiates " quest " from something you\'d see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . \n ( compare kayley and garrett\'s run-in with the angry ogre to herc\'s battle with the hydra . \ni rest my case . ) \neven the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . \nin the end , it\'s a tie -- they all win . \nthat dragon\'s comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . \nat least fans of the early-\'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel " urkel " white and bronson " balki " pinchot sharing the same footage . \na few scenes are nicely realized ( though i\'m at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don\'t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . \nbut one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . \naside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , " quest for camelot " \'s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . \nand personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way . \n'

aS'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \nthe narrator states that " this is the story of daryl gleason " and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \nfor some reason , this genre\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \nstalked is no exception ( it\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \nstalked\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \nmaryam d\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the " stalked " of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \nbrooke ( d\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \nto ensure he won\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \nof course not . \nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\'s intelligence . \nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \nif you\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \n'

aS'capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . \nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . \njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . \njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . \nfor a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . \nghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . \nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . \nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . \nit is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . \nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . \nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . \nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film\'s budget ) . \nit is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . \nsociety has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . \napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . \nand from carpenter\'s view , women have really made a mess of things . \nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . \nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \ninstead of having the criminal " napolean " wilson , this film has the criminal " desolation " williams . \ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \nthe story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . \nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . \ni rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nfollowing the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter\'s classic assault on precinct 13 . \nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . \n'

aS'so ask yourself what " 8mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about . \nis it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? \nis it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there\'s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won\'t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? \nor is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? \ni\'m not talking about snuff films , supposed " documentaries " of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . \ni\'m talking about films like " 8mm " and its director , joel schumacher . \nwith a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- " batman & robin , " " a time to kill , " " batman forever , " " the client " --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . \nis " 8mm " something you really want to see ? \nprobably not . \nthe first two-thirds of " 8mm " unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . \nthen , as it\'s been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . \nand just when you think it\'s finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . \ntrust me . \nthere are better ways to waste two hours of your life . \nnicolas \' " snake eyes " \' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband\'s safe documents a young girl\'s murder . \nwelles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don\'t need any specialized skills or training to do this . \nwelles certainly makes it look easy . \nand cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . \nthe deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader\'s " hardcore . " \noccasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . \nthere are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . \n " 8mm " doesn\'t condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . \nthe irony , of course , is that schumacher and " seven " scribe andrew kevin walker\'s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . \nso we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . \nlater it\'s the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who\'s quite good and by far the film\'s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . \nall this to get to the familiar yet offensive " revelation " that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . \nneither super nor standard , " 8mm " is shocking only in its banality . \n'

aS'that\'s exactly how long the movie felt to me . \nthere weren\'t even nine laughs in nine months . \nit\'s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . \nit\'s not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it\'s the fact that grant is annoying . \nnot just adam sandler-annoying , we\'re talking jim carrey-annoying . \nsince when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? \nbut , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant\'s head in joan cusack\'s lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant\'s pregnant girlfriend she has " a big pussy , " referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? \nnine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . \nhugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . \nwhy a child psychologist ? \nso the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : \nkid : my dad\'s an asshole . \ngrant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? \nkid : my dad\'s a _huge_ asshole . \nmore like a hugh asshole , but that\'s beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . \nso , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . \nthis paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant\'s equally annoying friend\'s wife is also pregnant . \nthe annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed " arnie the dinosaur " ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . \nthe only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . \nnot even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . \nhis is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? \nthat\'s my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line " now it\'s time to take a look at your volvo , " another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds\' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . \nnine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . \nhugh grant\'s sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won\'t leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant\'s nervous smiles . \neverything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . \nover 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . \nbut at least they didn\'t spend 60 bucks for it . \n'

aS'call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it\'s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \nthat\'s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \nthey haven\'t spoken in years , and wouldn\'t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren\'t for kaisa\'s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn\'t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn\'t fallen very far from the tree . \nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \nain\'t they a pair ? \nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \nby the time they reach the hospital , it\'s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they\'re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \naberdeen doesn\'t know where else to go . \nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \nheadey\'s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she\'d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \nit\'s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter\'s captivating signs & wonders . \nit\'s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they\'re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \ndespite skarsg ? rd\'s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \nthere\'s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \nnossiter\'s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it\'s willing to stretch beyond what we\'ve come to expect from traditional drama . \naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan\'s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin\'s hollywood mogul pronounces , " all of life\'s riddles are answered in the movies ! " \neven foreign films are taking that advice to heart . \n'

aS"best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . \nusually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda . \ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \nhe's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \nhe'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \nhe's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do . \nthis makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven . \nthere is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \nwe're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . \nthe restraint is admirable . \nbut l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . \nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . \nit's too much . \nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \nit's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \nin this regard , l . i . e . \n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \nhow often does real life work this way ? \nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \n"

aS'janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . \nthis is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . \nit also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . \ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . \ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that\'s made the kennedy family so popular . \nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . \nshe soon learns why " easier said than done " is the mantra of movies like this . \nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can\'t get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . \nthen comes what roger ebert calls the " meet cute . " \nit happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . \nin the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o\'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . \nno points for guessing it\'s the same dog that just made water on her luggage . \nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates o\'hara on sight . \nthat\'s how it works in movies like these . \ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she\'d hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they\'d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . \ni haven\'t mentioned the movie\'s twist yet . \ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . \nmilo o\'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . \nrest assured he\'ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o\'hara . \noh , and in keeping with the matchmaker\'s utter predictability , he dies toward the end . \nwhat the message here ? \nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . \ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . \nleary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . \nhe even undoes himself with the old microphone\'s still on after he\'s done giving the speech cliche . \nboth of them should have known better . \n'

aS"and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . \nthis time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . \nby bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . \nthe end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . \nthe story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . \nd'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . \nhe travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . \nin paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . \nhe finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison . \nd'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . \ndirector peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . \none problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . \njet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . \nironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . \nmost asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . \nthe musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . \nchambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! \nand hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . \n"

aS'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \nfirst , there\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \nno no . . . \njust kidding . \nhad you going there for a moment , didn\'t i ? \nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \ni\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\'t try to overachieve . \nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \nshao khan has decided that he\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought " hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . " \ntoo bad they didn\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \n * the acting is truly bad . \nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim " tiny " lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite " utility " actors but he\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n . . . unless you\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \nsonya does her " kiss of death , " jax does his " earthquake , " liu kang does his " animality , " and so on . \na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n * there aren\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \nsilly , silly folks . \nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their " animalities . " \nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \nyou\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \n'

aS'she was the femme in " la femme nikita .

aS'john carpenter makes b-movies . \nalways has ( " halloween , " " escape from new york , " " the thing " ) and , by the looks of it ( " they live , " " escape from l . a . , " " vampires " ) , always will . \ncarpenter\'s latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled " john carpenter\'s ghosts of mars " ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else\'s " ghosts of mars " ) . \nlike all those films prefixed by the very possessive " john carpenter\'s , " " ghosts of mars " is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects . \nin category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) . \ndormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes . \nall this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- " species " films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train . \nofficer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james " desolation " williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture . \nin the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named " desolation " ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn\'t need to try too hard . \nin category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird\'s-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) . \nstate-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn\'t waste any of the film\'s budget in that department . \n " ghosts of mars " is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry . \nthe film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly . \ncarpenter might like to think he\'s made a western here but it\'s a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts . \nit\'s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken . \ni never thought i\'d miss the guy but i do . \nit\'s not * all * the same , however . \ndubbed the " one-note wonder " for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work . \nfortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue . \nthe final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless . \nmars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn " mission to mars " and " red planet " ( with val kilmer ) . \n " ghosts of mars " sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them " american pie 2 " and " rush hour 2 " ) . \nthe irony is that the mars in carpenter\'s film feels sadly absent . \nthere are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth\'s closest neighbor . \ntwo things keep " john carpenter\'s ghosts of mars " from getting a huge slap upside the head . \n1 . \nhenstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn\'t pretend to be anything it\'s not . \nwhat that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck . \n'

aS'i\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i\'m the only one who doesn\'t like it . \none girl said if i\'d seen the movie with " an open mind , " i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i\'m crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\'t me ) yelled out , " that was the worst f$&#in\' movie i\'ve ever seen " and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\'s too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\'s taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can\'t call it a sex flick . \ni\'ve already pointed out that it can\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n'

aS'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \nwell , whatever it is , you\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\'re left with here . \nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \nit\'s like i said . . . this \nmovie sucks . \nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \nuneven , would be another . \nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it\'s actually going to go " somewhere " . \nbut it isn\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the " pain " of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \nin a sci-fi movie ? \nwell , i don\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their " misadventures in space " for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \nof course , i don\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \nugh . \nwhat a friggin\' mess . \nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \ndidn\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \ndidn\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\'t saying much ! ) . \nof course , you can\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \n\'nuff said . \nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \nears hurt ! ) . \nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \nsure . \ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the " sand-twister " effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \nother than that ? \ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , \ndid i say " admire " , i meant " am disgusted " ! \nall in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \nthere\'s a great movie ! \nand on a personal note , i think it\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \n'

aS'the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film\'s end . \nif you\'re not familiar with this law , then maybe you\'ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film\'s end . \nnow if you\'re a regular reader of mine , you\'ve heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? \nno , it definitely is not . \nmelissa joan hart ( from abc\'s " sabrina , the teenage witch " ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . \nadrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who\'s just broken up with his activist girlfriend . \napparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . \nso the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . \nwill grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? \nwill this crazy scheme work ? \ndo i care ? \nthe teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . \nwhat makes movies like can\'t hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she\'s all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . \ni don\'t know what the writer\'s intention was with drive me crazy . \nthere was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . \nhere there\'s nothing . . . \njust teens whining about who\'s going to take them to the big dance . \ndo me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . \njust shut the hell up . \nin all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits . \nnow normally when i say that it\'s followed with the joke " . . . because the movie is finally over . " \nin this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . \nafter the obligatory second playing of britney spears\' titular song , there\'s a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . \nnothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . \nsci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries " v " and " v : the final battle " ) . \n[pg-13] \n'

aS'mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . \nhis entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . \njoe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . \nduring this scene , i turned to my friend and said , " wow . \nthat\'s some ape . " \njoe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . \nhe runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . \nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively . \nhe breaks things on accident , because he\'s just too big to avoid clumsiness . \njoe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . \nas a character , he doesn\'t quite register . \nand the story he\'s been put in is as limp as they come . \nthe words " family entertainment " have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . \nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film . \nit\'s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . \nthe main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . \nas a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . \nspecifically , she\'s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . \nsoon , zoologist gregg o\'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill\'s mother . \nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill\'s mother . \njill , of course , doesn\'t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \nthe movie isn\'t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \nbut the story is really dumb , there aren\'t any characters , and the film isn\'t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it\'s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like " joe isn\'t happy ! " \nand " joe isn\'t safe here ! " \n " we need to get joe out of here ! " \n " joe is way too big for that cage ! " \ni don\'t know if these phrases are word for word , but they\'re close . \nas i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . \npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . \nsadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . \nthere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . \nit\'s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . \nbut adults in the audience aren\'t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . \na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . \nnobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . \n'

aS' " spawn " features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster . \nit not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them . \nin a classic example of telling and not showing , " spawn " opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how " men are the ones who create evil on earth . " \nso much for a message . \nthe movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant . \nsimmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil\'s army to overtake the world , he\'ll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) . \nof course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons\' partner ( d . b . \nsweeney ) . \nhis , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan\'s . \nclown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn . \nwynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that " makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . " \nphew . got all that ? \nit would be easy to dismiss " spawn " as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn\'t even work on that level . \nthe computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated . \nthe several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie\'s healthy budget you\'d think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks . \nother elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn\'s enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it\'s too obvious when he\'s being played by a costumed actor or an image . \nin movies like " contact , " the special effects serve the story . \nin " spawn , " they are the story . \nand spawn himself isn\'t even an interesting character . \nthe film\'s reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped . \nwhat we need is a batman , a luke skywalker . \neven watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn . \npoor leguizamo . \nhe starred in february\'s " the pest , " a movie that i still think is the year\'s worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money . \nas clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline . \nleguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon . \nthe guy was brilliant in " to wong foo , thanks for everything ! \njulie newmar . " \nwhat is he doing wasting his talent in this and " the pest " ? \ni\'m one of the few people that liked " batman & robin , " this summer\'s other big-budget comic book film . \nyet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of " batman " as the superior adaptation . \nthere\'s a compelling story somewhere in " spawn " -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it\'s just not found anywhere near here . \nas it is , " spawn " is just awful -- it stinks worse than a dead trout . \n'

aS' " in dreams " might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . \nno , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie\'s brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . \nthe big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind " the crying game . " \nhe\'s no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . \nthings start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji\'s stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . \nthis eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there\'s even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn\'t deserve so good a polish , it\'s this one . \ndon\'t knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . \nannette bening , another asset " in dreams " shouldn\'t be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn\'t do much for her in return . \nshe plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children\'s book illustrator who\'s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . \nshe thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . \nthis being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it\'s a credit to bening\'s acting that she delves equally into claire\'s madness and compassion . \nbut as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , " in dreams " trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . \nscenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . \nsubplots appear and disappear . \nwhen claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he\'s clairvoyant and he\'s got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . \n " in dreams " reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . \nsome questions , then : what\'s with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? \nare the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? \nwho cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? \nwhat about the computer ? \ndoes vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? \nwhy would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? \nis the woman in australia integral to anything ? \nand the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? \nsigh . \nat least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn\'t go to waste . \n'

aS' " knock off " is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . \nit\'s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . \ni figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . \njean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . \nrob schneider plays van damme\'s partner , and rochon plays . . . \nactually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . \nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . \nmany things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . \nwhere chan comes off as endearing in his " normal guy " character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . \nwe\'re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . \nto be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . \nthe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . \ntsui hark ( who directed van damme\'s last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , " double team " ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that\'s no exaggeration . \nwe are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme\'s foot entering a shoe . \nfabulous ! \nseriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don\'t get carried away . \nfor example , look at sam raimi . \n " army of darkness " , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . \nthat\'s a concept that tsui can\'t seem to grasp . \nthe special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * " knock off " to the point where the audience doesn\'t have a clue as to what\'s happening any more . \nanother problem with the film is that it looks cheap . \nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . \nand for some inexplicable reason , everyone\'s voice seems to have been dubbed . \neven the stars . \nand even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . \nfor example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . \nthe car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . \nseconds later , the car drives off at full speed . \nhey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . \nfinally , the acting . \nnobody gives a good performance in this film . \nvan damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing " everyman " . \nand schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . \neven the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . . \nonce again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . \nin case i haven\'t yet made it clear enough , " knock off " is the worst movie of van damme\'s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . \nand it\'s not even one of those movies that\'s so bad it\'s funny . \nit\'s too inept to be funny . \nthere are no redeeming factors in " knock off " and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . \n'

aS' " snake eyes " is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \nit\'s not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he\'s a great director and one who\'s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \nand it\'s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \nit\'s worse than that . \nit\'s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \nin certain circles , " snake eyes " was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa\'s classic " rashomon , " where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who\'s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who\'s also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \nthere\'s a big name in the crowd , and that\'s the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who\'s sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \ndiscovers there\'s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness\' takes on what happened . \nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it\'s extremely interesting to watch . . . then \nit takes one wrong step . \nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \nbut that\'s not the worst part of it : it\'s that it\'s the one person you didn\'t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn\'t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can\'t rely on rick\'s investigation to be all that interesting . \nit\'s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \nthat\'s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \nthis time , it\'s a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \nwhat went wrong ? \ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , " blow out , " where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \nthen there\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\'s earlier " carlito\'s way , " a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \nhe\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\'t so formulaic . \na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\'d be given , and perhaps he\'d have to make a choice between who\'s he has to believe . \nnow there\'s a film . \nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \n'

aS"forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \nthe play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . \nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . \nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \notherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . \nryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \nunfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \n"

aS'one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . \nafter all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . \nhe is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . \nhowever , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . \nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . \nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . \nit is edgar\'s ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : " it\'s only when things are over that they make sense . " \nwhether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . \nthe thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . \ninstead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . \nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you\'re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . \nbut don\'t fret , it will surface again . \nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . \nbut you hold hope for some time . \nthe background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . \nit\'s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . \nand with speeches like , " i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , " how can you expect to hold anyone\'s interest ? \nto godard\'s credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . \nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . \nwatching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . \nand if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . \nthe environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . \nunfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . \nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . \nthe second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . \nyou suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . \nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . \nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular . \nwhile i\'ll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it\'s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . \nit just goes to show , an intelligent person isn\'t necessarily an admirable storyteller . \nthe days of breathless are no more . \n'

aS'america loves convenience . \nafter all , we\'re the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control . \nyet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far . \nghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin\' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve " demolition " williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . \nwhen she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed " the commander , " " the rookies , " and the guy with the cool accent discover the town\'s residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents\' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches . \nfilled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences . \nthe only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story . \nripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose . \nattempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced . \nmost of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube . \nwith a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to " me and my brother when we was kids . " \napparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment . \nbut , even in the film\'s darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite . \nyes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt . \nand as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand . \ncharacters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? \nas long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed . \neventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson . \nwhat better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can\'t handle . \nexplosions are fun . \nand even if the nukes don\'t get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will . \nin the end this film defines itself when our cop\'s tribunal pronounces , " is that all you have to tell us ? " \nfor , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story . \n'

aS'reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \nthe guy can\'t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : " rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel " ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , " oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! " \nit\'s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \nauteur theory be damned ; it\'s kruger\'s " style " , not the director\'s that winds up on screen . \nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut " sometimes less is more " . \nand his numerous twists can\'t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd\'s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn\'t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the " character " . . . grammar \nbe damned ) . \n " how did you know that ? " \nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \n . \n . \nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger\'s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it\'s no wonder why he works so frequently . \nhe\'s quickly becoming miramax\'s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \ntheir company\'s current logo could be " we ride the trends " . \nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \naffleck is such a puppy dog that it\'s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone\'s bitch . \nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent " serious " movie getting . \nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who\'s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \njames frain is nick , rudy\'s cellmate , a manslaughterer who\'s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she\'s never seen one picture of him . \nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i\'ve described might as well be irrelevant . \nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \nthough it\'s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \n'

aS'a follow-up to disney\'s live-action " 101 dalmatians " that\'s better , more entertaining than the first ? \njust as unlikely . \nwith " 102 dalmatians , " the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \n1996\'s " 101 dalmatians " certainly wasn\'t the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close\'s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \nbut that\'s only half the problem with kevin lima\'s laborious film . \nwhat makes " 102 dalmatians " such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he\'s a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic " heroes " of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can\'t even aspire to that . \nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close\'s split ends are more animated . \nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro\'s in " men of honor . " \njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu\'s over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . \nfrance\'s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in " 102 dalmatians " the producers milk that realization for all it\'s worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as " poopies , " par example ( and ad nauseum ) . \nthe finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \nthat done , it\'s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . \nthe dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that\'s pretty much all they are . \nthere\'s always the feeling that there\'s a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . \nsavvy holiday goers should skip " 102 dalmatians " and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . \nit\'s one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . \n'

aS'one-sided " doom and gloom " documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . \norson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . \nthe film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the " future " never do . \nfor example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth . \nwe\'re still here . \nthe arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse . \nwe\'re still here . \nsome of the more ludicrous moments come when it\'s alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . \nalso , there\'s ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like . \nif it\'s anything like it\'s depicted as here then it\'s going to be incredibly boring . \nthe late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video . \nit contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed . \nalso included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods . \naudio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this . \ni believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me . \ncertainly i never expected a remastered print . \ncuriously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case . \nbut they\'re menu screens . . . \nso who really cares ? \n[pg] \n'

aS'play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton\'s sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . \nlike most of shelton\'s other great films ( bull durham , white men can\'t jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . \nshelton\'s films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . \nshelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . \nplay it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . \nthe film has no social message like its predecessors . \nthe relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons . \nthe whole film , since it is primarily a " buddy picture , " depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other . \nunfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . \n1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . \nthe two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory . \n2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas . \nthere is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something . \n3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way . \nshe is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other . \n4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories . \nvince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner . \nthese boring tales only hurt the central plot . \n5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don\'t even hesitate to pound each other . \nwasn\'t the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? \nby the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over . \nshelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story . \nforty five painful minutes remain . \nthe boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies . \nhowever , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film . \n'

aS'some movies i should just skip . \nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . \ntrue , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it\'s a cartoon . \nbut it\'s a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . \nbut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? \nturns out i was right , mostly . \ninspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . \nat first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . \nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where " formula " isn\'t just business , it\'s a way of life . \nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . \nin some parts you can just hear them saying " more zany ! \ni want more zany here -- and -- here . " \n " let\'s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . \ni want the audience squirming in their seats . " \n " ok , that\'s fine , but i want you to add bug guts . " \n " what does this scene do ? \ncharacter depth ? \nbut where\'s the zaniness ? \ni don\'t see zany here . \nif you can\'t make it zany , cut it ! " \nthe latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . \nmichelle ( who plays penny , gadget\'s niece ) shines in every scene she\'s in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . \nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . \ndabney coleman\'s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . \ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . \nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the " gidget bitch from hell " town mayor . \noteri\'s overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon\'s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn\'t poking fun at our fair town . \nor , maybe all career politicians are like that . \ni must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . \nhe appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . \nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . \njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . \nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . \nd . l . hughley plays the shuckin\'-and-jivin\' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . \nthe dialog is . . . let\'s face it , it\'s pretty bad . \nthe tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . \na lot of the lines ( especially hughley\'s ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . \nabout three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . \ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really " battles " ) with the evil gadget . \npenny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . \nlet me rage here just for a minute . \nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . \nshe\'s utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . \nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . \nthe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . \ninspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it\'s a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . \nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . \nthe " evil sidekick support group " is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it\'s onscreen . \nall in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . \ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for it\'s generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . \nbut if true , why ? \nif they\'re trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . \n'

aS'hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . \nthe last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . \nin a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . \nwith the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong\'s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . \nsuch talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . \nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . \nunfortunately " romeo must die " bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong\'s rhythms . \nthe film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . \nenter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . \nkai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai\'s boss and leader of the local chinese family . \na battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . \nit\'s not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . \nthe following morning po sing is found dead . \nsuspicions escalate , as issac o\'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . \nhis concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . \nissac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . \nthe scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . \nhe fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . \nhung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . \nescaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother\'s death . \n " romeo must die " is in many ways a fun film . \nit is both absurd and assured . \nthe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes " the godfather " . \nthe relationship between jet li\'s han and aaliyah\'s trish o\'day reminds us of abel ferrera\'s " china girl " , except that romeo must die\'s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . \ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . \nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . \nli , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . \nallayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . \nit\'s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . \nbut , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . \ndelro lindo as issac o\'day carries himself well in the film . \nan unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . \nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac\'s son , colin . \nthe performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . \nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . \nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . \nhaving a career as one of the industry\'s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and " romeo must die " does look good . \nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . \nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . \nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . \nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah\'s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . \nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes . \njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . \none needs only to see his film " fist of legend " to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . \nhere , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that " lethal weapon 4 " ( jet\'s u . s . debut ) didn\'t allow . \nunfortunately , a lot of jet\'s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \nalso " romeo must die " must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba\'s " streetfighter " , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \nit\'s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \none problem though about the fight scenes . \nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . \nthey do have an internal rhythm to them . \na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \nhere in " romeo must die " , there is no staccato . \nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \nthe rhythm is monotonous . \na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \n\'rmd\' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan\'s films . . \nwatch the restaurant fight from the film " rush hour " and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \nnow look at the warehouse fight from " rumble in the bronx " . \nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn\'t let the audience catch its breath . \nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \nhere in \'romeo must die\' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \nit\'s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . \nuntil then , we\'ll be left with emotionally hollow product like " the replacement killer " and , currently " romeo must die " . \n'

aS'i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . \ni bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . \nthrow in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! \nwe\'ll have a hit on our hands ! " \nthe replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . \nthe story is loosely based around the pro football players\' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . \nkeanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . \ngene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . \nrounding out the cast includes swingers\' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . \nthis bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny\'s . \nthe usual things happen like clockwork . \nthe hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . \nit\'s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . \nhoward deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of \'80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . \nobviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . \nsports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . \nthe replacements offers none of this . \n'

aS'if you\'re into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then " bully " \'s for you . \nbased on jim schutze\'s novelization of a true-life event , " bully " charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood . \nthe film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers . \nin the hands of controversial director larry clark ( " kids " ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker\'s pornographic proclivities . \nin terms of the incident and what provoked it , " bully " stirs up nothing new . \nthe high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane . \nthe bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn\'t exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department . \nhe hounds and harries and humiliates his " best friend " marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty\'s girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn\'t care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby . \nsimply remove him from the equation . \nmarty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off . \nthere\'s no remorse--the next day they\'re talking about it as openly as a homework assignment . \nthey did it because they wanted to , and because they could . \nwhat\'s most troubling about the film , however , isn\'t the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material . \nnot only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in " bully " but there\'s also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . \ngratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in " there\'s something about mary " look like the height of subtlety ! ) . \nclark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about . \nthe stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera . \nthe conclusion of " bully " offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime . \nit\'s a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it\'s infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it . \n " bully " aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death . \n'

aS"among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . \nthose who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . \nas director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . \nthe protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . \nhowever , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . \none stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . \nhowever , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . \nbelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . \nunfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . \nthe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . \nthe actors that play them don't help either . \nthat is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . \nhis partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . \nginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . \n"

aS' " lake placid " marks yet another entry in the series of " predator pics " that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- " jaws " ) and were revived recently by the godawful " anaconda . " \n " placid " claims to be a " horror/comedy " -it\'s directed by the same guy who did " house " -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of " anaconda . " \npaleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . \ndiscovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn\'t even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . \nthey\'re joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . \nalong the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . \nyou know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone\'s dangling legs while " jaws " -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who\'s obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can\'t possibly exist . \nunlike its slippery cousin " anaconda , " " lake placid " wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . \nthe result is neither scary nor funny ; it\'s just tedious . \nwhile director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of " friday the 13th " and " halloween h20 " ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like " ally mcbeal " and " chicago hope " ) doesn\'t seem to have the stomach for a chomp \'em up flick . \nthe body count is surprisingly low and doesn\'t include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . \n ( " lake placid " manages to have it both ways-i\'ll let you discover how for yourself ) . \nthe croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . \nlike the snake in " anaconda , " the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn\'t seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . \n " lake placid " also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . \nthere is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how " we really don\'t know much about crocodiles . " \nthey would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . \na movie like this doesn\'t have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? \ncreature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . \npullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . \nmost of the time , they\'re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . \nplatt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . \n'

aS'capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? \nstarship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . \nit is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it\'s so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . \nit\'s one of the worst movies i\'ve seen in a long time . \nwhy am i calling this movie pornography ? \npornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . \ni remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as " a near-pornographic eternity " . \ni didn\'t agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout " do \'er , man , do \'er ! " \nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . \nit\'s * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . \nit tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . \nthe film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn\'t appear to have intelligence . \nto counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they\'re clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . \nthis isn\'t heinlein , it\'s a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . \n ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) \nthe soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . \nthey do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . \nthey don\'t even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don\'t care about them . \nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . \nhere , we don\'t even hate the bugs -- what\'s there to hate ? \nhating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . \nif there\'s anything really hateful there , the movie doesn\'t know how to give it to us . \nthe screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be " screen typist " ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . \none of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who\'s great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . \nonce or twice is fine . \nby the fifth or sixth time , it\'s worn out its welcome . \nthere\'s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . \nalso , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . \nif a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . \nbut if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . \nuh-huh . \nthe very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . \ni say " quasi- " because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn\'t have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . \nthe bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . \nlike the rest of the movie . \nthere\'s more , i suppose , but it\'s not worth it . \nthe acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . \nthe heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece . \n'

aS'the classic story & the production which ruined it \nmarking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . \nof course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) . \nthe story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea . \ndouglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize . \nhis host\'s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau\'s lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress . \neven worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal " people . " \ndouglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker . \nusing shock-therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled . \nthe island of dr . \nmoreau questions the ability of men playing god . \ndr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long . \nmoreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp . \neven so , the production has failed to make the most out of it . \nthere are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not " prioritized " so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather \nungloriously at times too . \nperhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau\'s creations . \nthe two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably . \nmore screen time could have been used for character interaction and development . \ni really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau\'s obsession , montgomery\'s purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel . \nmaybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to " cut a long story short " and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it\'s still summer , and movies have to be " marketable " ) . \nthe special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about . \nat most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes . \nthis h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film . \nunfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story . \nas a third outing , the island of dr . moreau \naccomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes\' . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n'

aS"lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient . \ngreat acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow . \nralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler's list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy . \nthe story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing . \nanyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse . \nshe was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot . \ncount almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) . \nhis love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave . \nhe returned to find her dead and was heart-broken . \nso he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground . \ndon't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is . \nmaybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle . \nthe only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography . \nother than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film . \n , \n"

aS"out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . \nthough the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough . \nin an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . \nhe has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . \nhe doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . \nvalentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . \nhe's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 . \nseeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . \nhe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . \nhe winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . \nwhat a mess . \ni have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . \nthe limey does exactly that . \nthe plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . \nthere is no method to this movie's madness . \nit uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . \nthe plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . \nthis is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . \ni felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . \nditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . \nsixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . \nhe's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . \npeter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective . \nhe's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . \nthis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . \nwhy soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work . \nthe result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work . \n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . \nshall we go back to basics ? \n"

aS'a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists . \nin the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko\'s script or direction makes you care much about either character . \nliving in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other . \nthis uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant . \n24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine " frame . " \nalthough the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy ) . \nfor her to do photos for " frame , " lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her . \nlucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson . \nthe two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin . \nthis does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture . \nsyd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club . \nlucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother . \nlucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being " pigeonholed , " and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that\'s how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses . \na typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer\'s work is transcendental or merely classical . \nthat no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny . \n " your work has a cultural currency that is important now , " is the artist-speak that the frame\'s manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine . \nwhen the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , " i want to get high with you . " \nin lucy\'s world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand . \nand the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene . \nthis vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions . \nin another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted . \nhigh art runs 1 : 36 . \nit is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age . \n'

aS' " party camp , " is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i\'ve seen in awhile . \na late rip-off of the " meatballs " series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . \nthat\'s really about all that can be said about the " plot " because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . \nhow fun ! \nsince , " party camp , " has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . \nit\'s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . \neven a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . \nat least , then , it wouldn\'t have been such a chore to sit through . \nnever before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . \nthe comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn\'t the least bit funny . \nit was groan-inducing . \nconstantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . \nso what saves , " party camp , " from the dreaded zero star rating ? \nwell , that\'s simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . \nalthough nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy . \n'

aS'when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right . \npredictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you\'s and the drive me crazy\'s released by the dozens these last couple of years . \nwhat i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i\'m sitting in the theater . \nam i enjoying myself ? \nis this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? \nthis is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won\'t remember next week . \nso last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review . \ndaily news ? \nnegative . \nreelviews ? \nnegative . \nepinions . com ? \nnegative . \nthis was nothing new . \namerican pie , final destination , road trip didn\'t get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures . \nsame goes for she\'s all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded . \nsince boys and girls reunites she\'s all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again . \nbut , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive . \ni had made up my mind ; i\'ll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years . \nbut , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn\'t get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls . \nwhoops . \nboys and girls is about a " nerdy , smart " boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a " popular , flirt " girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) . \nbriefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends . \nbut in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other . \nwith advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship . \nthe film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found . \ni could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons . \nthe dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to . \nit is almost offensive . \nan example of an insightful conversation : \n " you\'re dumb . \ndumb , dumb , dumb , dumb .

aS'all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996\'s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante\'s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \nno number of name changes can help this picture . \nit\'s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \nfrom that moment on , it\'s all downhill . \nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \nthere\'s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \nit\'s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren\'t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \nthe film\'s conclusion is so preposterous that it\'s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \nthere\'s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv\'s " lou grant " ) , get stuck on a street that\'s rapidly turning into a river . \na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg\'s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \nthere isn\'t any real acting in this film . \nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn\'t trust nature\'s fury as the chief engine of conflict . \nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \n'

aS'instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as " powerful " or " touching " . \ni have a name for it myself : " gross " . \nthis is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the " rebel " threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . \nhow that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren\'t present day moviegoers beyond being " inspired " by something like that ? \nthis is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience\'s intelligence . \ninstinct\'s plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . \nhe was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . \nafter committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison\'s " psychotics ward " . \nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . \ncaulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . \nof course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . \nand then there\'s the inevitable " heartless meanie " character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder\'s mentor . \nhe cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . \nlet\'s get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . \nany good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . \nnot good old theo . \nno , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says " we need to talk about this right now . " \nthis is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct\'s already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it\'s also the least of its problems . \ndirector jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie\'s promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . \nit\'s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . \nit aims to " inspire " rather than to touch hearts . \nas yoda would say , inspire it does not . \nit is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie\'s story . \nindeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film\'s plot to another character . \nthis , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . \ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . \ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . \noscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . \nhis performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . \ni liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . \ni love animals , and instinct\'s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . \nhowever this movie\'s execution is completely unacceptable . \ntone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov \n'

aS"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . \nhe is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . \nbut , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation . \na stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category . \nthe heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . \nduring one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . \nin order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . \nemily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . \nconcluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . \nthat isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . \nthings get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . \nusing peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film . \neven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . \nbut the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . \nthe author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . \nrole of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them . \nfirst of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better . \nscreenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . \nbut , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . \nalso , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . \nthat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . \n"

aS' " the world on land -- it\'s just too big for me . " \nstarring tim roth , pruitt taylor vince , bill nunn , clarence williams iii . \nrated r . \nthe legend of 1900s is the year\'s most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast . \nit stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named . . . \n1900 . \nyou heard right . \nhis name is , in all actuality , 1900 . \nhe was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman . \n1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny\'s fear that he might be taken away from him because of " visa matters . " \nwell , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship . \none day , he discovers a grand piano . \nhe sits down and starts playing . \nmiraculously , what comes out is beautiful . \na group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age . \nwhen one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is " totally against regulations " 1900 replies " f * ck the regulations ! " \nho ho ho . \n1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land . \nwhen he\'s about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody\'s business , onboard comes another musician . \nhis name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet . \nafter 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano\'s braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it . \nhow the chair they\'re sitting on and the piano don\'t separate , i don\'t know , but this apparently isn\'t the kind of thing we\'re supposed to ask . \nafter that , 1900 and max become friends . \nmax is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so . \nwhat\'s more , he doesn\'t even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp ! \n-- they\'re going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record . \nthe conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900\'s music in a store . \nthe record shouldn\'t exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken . \nladies and gentlemen , it\'s a mystery ! \nthe story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements . \nwe\'re supposed to be roused by a climactic . . . \npiano duel ? \nthere isn\'t anything in this movie with the potential to compel . \n1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i can\'t recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life . \nditto for max , who doesn\'t seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 . \ntim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there\'s no spirit , no gusto to the character . \nhe insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead . \npruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit . \nthe highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering " king of jazz " who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel . \nthe legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many . \nthis effort is utterly limp and lifeless . \nat once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten . \n'

aS'my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . \nas lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . \n ( " without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . " ) \nlanguidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . \nsince it\'s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . \nother than a few nice visuals , there\'s nothing to recommend the picture . \nwith great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he\'s more than the world\'s best oscar host . \nhe does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year\'s father\'s day and this year\'s my giant . \none wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project . \nsurely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . \nperhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . \nor maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie\'s somber tone . \nthe most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . \nthis one-joke movie\'s single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . \nsammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) . \nafter throwing out constant one-liners ( " either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . " ) , \nsammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket . \nand although he doesn\'t like it , he\'s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . \n ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) \nafter a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . \nwe learn that max\'s condition is terminal , and he will soon die . \nto be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . \nlet\'s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . \nmy giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . \nit is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . \nmy son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . \nmatthew pointed out that it " is not as good as it could have been or should have been .

aS'talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! \nspice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . \nit\'s intended as a sort of hard day\'s night , but ends up simply hard to watch . \nwhen watching the spice girls , i\'m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . \nthe spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . \nthere\'s ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you\'re almost certain the post sticks out her throat . \nthe film itself doesn\'t really have a plot . \nit follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their " first live performance " at albert hall . \nthe action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . \nthe various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even \nwhen they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . \nwhew . \nfor some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . \nfrom elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . \nheck , even roger moore shows up , though he can\'t decide if he\'s parodying himself as james bond , or if he\'s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . \nrichard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band\'s manager , clifford . \nthe celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . \nneither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . \ntheir songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . \nmy advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either \noption will be more enjoyable than the film . \nnon-fans should know to stay well away from this one . \n'

aS"this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one . \nnot only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts , but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure . \nan original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance . \nthe screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience . \nthis is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching . \nsummer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . ) , a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country . \nryan is a blue-collar kind of guy . \nhe works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod's rich and famous . \nhe also , as we are informed early , his own worst enemy . \nhe has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment . \nso , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball . \nthen he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures . \ntenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan . \nif you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads , then you need a remedial course in film viewing . \nas always prinze is pretty to look at , but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination . \nbiel cries a lot , while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father . \nthe only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker , the team's catcher . \nsummer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural . \nno curve balls here , no sliders . \nevery pitch is predictable . \na blind umpire could call this movie . \nsummer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking . \nit has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn . \n"

aS'one of the responses those that enjoy " detroit rock city " ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i\'ve given the film might be something like : " oh , that casey\'s gone and become a jaded critic on us . \njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n\' roll movie like this ? " \ni\'m wondering the same thing . \ni feel like i should have had a grand time with " detroit rock city . " \nit\'s the sort of movie i wish i could\'ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn\'t . \ni just didn\'t . \nsurely this film isn\'t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \nno , but i expected something . \na funny joke . \na clever prank . \na plot development . \nanything . \nthe movie never delivers . \nyou\'ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \n " detroit rock city " is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film\'s existence , and it\'s not a very satisfying realization . \nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \nthat\'s it . \nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \nthey have a garage band . \nthey\'re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \nthey have tickets , they lose them . \nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \nthere\'s not much more to it . \nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \nshe doesn\'t want them to see kiss , if you hadn\'t figured that out already . \nit\'s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \nwe\'ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \nthen again , " maximum overdrive " had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \n " detroit rock city " doesn\'t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc\'s " highway to hell " sounds like something my neighbor\'s cat coughed up ) . \nit\'s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it\' s evident that they\'re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they\'ve got to make a living in hollywood . \npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn\'t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \nit\'s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at " the blair witch project " stay far away from " detroit rock city , " because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \ni haven\'t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since " armageddon . " \nand what about that script ? \nit\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\'ve ever heard . \nif it is , i can\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \na plotless , pointless rock n\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \nthe jokes in " detroit rock city " rarely are . \nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it " comedy . " \nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \nit\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , " see ? \nfunny ! " \nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \ntwice . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren\'t funny all by themselves . \nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn \'t predicted them five minutes in advance . \nthat\'s it , i\'ve said enough about this movie . \nit\'s a waste of time and money . \ni liked the music , but don\'t bother buying the soundtrack . \ni hear it\' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \nyou want to see this concept executed well ? \ngo rent roger corman\'s 1979 classic " rock n\' roll high school . " \nit features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . \nyes , go rent that , and skip " detroit rock city , " which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . \n'

aS'has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ? \nnineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong . \npolice academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small-town deputy sheriff corralled into co-coaching the school\'s hastily formed soccer team . \nhis partner-in-crime is the new british " exchange teacher " ( olivia d\'abo ) , a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer-city audience is to teach them something neat . \nlike soccer . \nmost of the good-natured gags are of the fast-motion variety , such as runaway cows and out-of-control lawnmowers . \nkids will laugh at the occasional belching bit , while their parents peacefully doze beside them . \nother than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed , what\'s missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy . \ninstead of a peppy pop score , which would arguably work to better effect , most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else . \ncomedy needs music . \njust watch any old bugs bunny short . \nthe marx brothers knew it . \nmel brooks knows it . \nunfortunately , the current trend is to " overscore . " \nlush strings and booming brass in every scene , at every moment . \nremember the simple strains of bizet\'s " habanera " in the original bad news bears ? \nthese days , it\'s usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path . \nmuch like adding frosting to already frosted cake . \nan awfully big adventure ======================== \nthe reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral . \ntheir second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern ( georgina cates ) struggling to survive in post-w . w . ii \nliverpool . \nhugh plays the gay director , an * extremely * unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months . \nbleak make-up and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into . \nan awful adventure is not without * some * rewards , tho . \nthe peter pan subtext is intriguing . \nas is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth , alan rickman , and prunella scales . \nbasil ! \ndevil in a blue dress ===================== \nthe comparisons to chinatown are easy enough , except for the fact that this film isn\'t nearly as gripping . \nwriter/director carl franklin ( one false move ) is the force behind this accomplished-but-stiff adaptation of walter mosley\'s crime novel . \ndenzel washington is as sturdy as ever , but he\'s burdened with a miscast supporting cast . \ntom sizemore and scene-stealer don cheadle are both fine . \nthe problems start with jennifer beales , who never registers as the plot\'s femme fatale . \nshe\'s a pretty face and nothing more . \nalso underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney . \nthey play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles . \njohn huston , we miss you ! \nfine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus . \nthey help to overcome a pace that\'s too polite for mosley\'s jazzy , swingin\' story . \nsteal big , steal little ======================= \ni can\'t say much about this one . \ndirector andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers ( andy garcia ) with opposing moral codes . \nthey\'re fighting over their adoptive mother\'s estate , a 40 , 000-acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers . \nso many different plots are trying to come together--feuding brothers , reconciling husbands , loan-shark hired hitmen--that you have to admire the director\'s ambition . \ntoo bad that almost every single person or plot-line is out of sync . \nthat is , with the exception of alan arkin . \nhe\'s the best thing in a movie that--despite the work of four credited writers-- * still * manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers , kevin mccarthy , and joe pantolinao . \nand what the heck does that title mean ? \n'

aS'funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . \nthe ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . \nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . \n " get new jobs ! " \nwas one line , if i remember correctly . \nat the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . \nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . \npatterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . \nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . \nthey are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . \ngive me a break . \nthe movie hasn\'t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it\'s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . \neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . \nget this : remington\'s big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . \nhe does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . \nby the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . \nthe acting is forgettable . \ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it\'s nothing he hasn\'t done before . \nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . \nthe camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . \nwhat did i expect from this movie ? \ni dunno . \nsome real excitement , i suppose . \na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . \nno such luck . \ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingway\'s " the short happy life of francis macomber " and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . \n'

aS"unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop . \nthere's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain . \nthe renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film . \nbo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . \non top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) . \nthen , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . \nright there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . \nbut right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point . \ndietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from . \nthe film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death . \nonce the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue . \nwhatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . \naside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . \nbaldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop . \npenn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop . \nwhat one tough cop lacks is originality . \nthis film offers nothing new . \nnothing that you can't get from any cop film . \nit screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico . \nbut even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film . \ntoo much else is lacking . \ni also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice . \nbut once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot . \nat times , i was hoping to see it . \none tough cop isn't laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just isn't unique . \nit is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made . \nbut one thing is for sure , it could really use a better title . \n"

" \noriginal ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv\'s friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she can\'t have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon . \nher boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls . \nwhat does she do ? \nshe invents a fiance ! \nthen when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female . \nhe , of course , goes along with it . \ngee , i wonder if they get together in the end . \ni\'ve seen more original stuff on the wb . \nand better stuff too . \npicture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston\'s character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch . \n'

aS'louie is a trumpeter swan with no voice . \nin order to woo his lady love serina , louie makes friends with a young boy , sammy , who persuades teacher mrs . hammerbottom ( carol burnett ) to allow louie to attend class . \nlouie learns to read and write and returns to his flock , but is laughed at once again when no other swans can understand his message of love for serina . \nto make matters worse , louie\'s father feels he\'s lost his honor because of the trumpet he stole for his son in this animated version of e . b . \nwhite\'s " trumpet of the swan . " \nas jane austen and henry james have become popular sources for adult filmmakers over the past decade or so , e . b . \nwhite is being returned to for children\'s films . \nthe animated " charlotte\'s web " has become a minor classic since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us a live action version of " stuart little . " \n " trumpet of the swan , " directed by richard rich ( 1999\'s animated " the king and i , " the " swan princess " series ) , is unlikely to be remembered along with those two . \n " trumpet of the swan " is receiving a regional theatrical release , but is sure to quickly appear on home video . \nboston is one of the targetted cities because our hero louie becomes famous playing his trumpet in beantown . \nhe encounters a gypsy-like con man in the public gardens who pitches louie and his trumpet as an added attraction to boston\'s swan boats . \nlouie stays at the ritz carlton before giving a concert at the hatch shell along the banks of the charles river . \nat this point , louie\'s earned enough money so that dad can pay for the trumpet and become musically capable enough to win over serina\'s father . \n " trumpet of the swan " features flat background art , some poor sound syncing and insipid , sugary songs . \nthis effort would be better suited to saturday morning television than the big screen , but may be ok for the real small set . \n'

aS'one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles . \nhe has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star . \nafter sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . \nunfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for . \nwe are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . \nthen the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . \nthe plot of men with guns can be summarized " in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas . \ndr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went . \nand he found out again and again and again . " \nof course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell . \na guerrilla war is always bad for civilians . \nbut the film talks down to the viewer . \ndr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country . \nhe has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . \nfuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . \nthen he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy . \nin shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others . \nthe student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be . \nfuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general . \nthe results are little different than one would expect . \ndr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive . \neven some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . \nbut fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . \nsayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . \nthe cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . \nfederico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos . \ndamian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter . \nmandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer . \n'

" \nand i\'ll stand there staring \'til i get a straight answer . \nsean penn stars u-turn , as bobby , a drifter who\'s had some troubles a while back . \nhe\'s heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose , stranding him in superior , arizona , held there by an " ignorant , inbred , turtleneck hick " of a mechanic named darrell . \nwhile darrell puts a new hose on the ride , bobby walks into town to see what\'s cooking . \nis it needless of me to say that superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ? \nprobably not . \nbobby meets up with grace ( jennifer lopez ) , who invites him back to her place , for drape-hanging and other domestic issues . \njust as those issues are starting up , grace\'s husband , jake , storms in , looking like check-out day of the elks lodge convention . \njust beats bobby silly . \nbobby takes to the road , only to meet up with jake again , and jake asks bobby to kill grace . \na little while later , grace asks bobby to kill jake . \nthem murderous arizonians . \ngotta love \'em . \nif any of this sounds familiar , congratulations . \nyou win a kewpie doll . \nthe story is a straight shoplift of red rock west , a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl , maker of the phenomenal the last seduction . \nbut the contest doesn\'t end there , guys and gals . \nwe get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty . \nwe get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak . \nlook at any schwarzenegger film , and you\'ll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick . \nbobby as terminator ? \nstretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic . \nokay , he\'s working from a book , so maybe ollie\'s not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas . \ni just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative . \ni just wish he hadn\'t brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub . \nsean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters . \nthe best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on . \ntoo bad it\'s not fun to watch when it\'s happening to us . . . while \nwe sit through this mess of a film . \nu-turn is not a bad film if you\'re a fan of technique . \nit\'s the oliver stone you\'ve always known . \nrobert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures . \nbut pictures of what ? \ni think i\'d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film . \nplot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i\'ve seen in the past five years . \noliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . \nyou\'ve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on . \nyour scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don\'t dog it . \nand i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun . \nthat\'s fine . \nbut don\'t do that with a movie with the potential of this one . \ndo some police academy sequel ( imagine that . ) \ndo a big comedy , like a remake of it\'s a mad , mad , mad , mad world . \nbut do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as " an oliver stone movie , " and not question why it stinks like week-old snook . \nthere\'s a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun . \nthis was as wrong as you can get without going to jail . \n'

aS"there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs . \none is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film . \ntwo is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta . \nto wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth . \na science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior . \nsci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs . \nbattlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes . \nhere's the `plot . ' \nthe year is 3000 . \nmankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . \na small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below . \nthe psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver . \na young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . ' \nhe is promptly captured and taken to the alien base . \nafter several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end . \njonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use . \nthen the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet . \nthe whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits . \nroger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . . \nand decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth . \nchristian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie ! \nand every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really . \nthe psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit . \ntravolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect . \njonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! ' \nthen there's the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve . \nwhy ? \nbecause terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid . ' \nterel may be right , you know . \nhumans made this movie . \n"

aS"would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ? \nlet me tell you what reality is . \nreality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . \nthat's reality . \namerica's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) . \nthe plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time . \nthe only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) . \ngosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage . \nveteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all . \n ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . ) \nand did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? \nand that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? \noh billy , you're a scamp ! \nthe script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? \nand bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one . \nyes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! \nif you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine . \nit's about to expire . \naside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , \namerica's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself . \ni didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film . \nbad move , billy -- your jokes suck . \nthe crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me . \njulia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here . \nobviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise . \nnone of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho . \nas for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work . \nhe's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years . \nit'll probably be another 11 before he's back again . \ni could drone on about how america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old . \ninstead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment . \nevery single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains . \nwhen you leave the theater , you'll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ? \n"

aS'rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality . \nstarring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko . \nrunning time : 117 minutes \ndirected by : christian duguay \ni\'ve never fully understood wesley snipes\'s career . \nhe has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs . \nhis best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled " blade " . \nhe has had his typical action movies , " boiling point " , " passenger 57 " , but his new movie " the art of war " should just be called " rising sun 2 : the art of war " cause basically it\'s a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance . \nwesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do . \nanne archer plays his " boss " type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer . \nwell snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way . \nall this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . \nwesley snipes isn\'t one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . \nthe only good role snipes has really had was in 1998\'s " blade " . \ni walked into " the art of war " expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush . \nthe only real \'good\' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on . \nthe ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock " the matrix " , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid . \nchristian duguay\'s direction is also not that great . \nhis camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done . \neven the whole " matrix " ending wasn\'t even good . \nthe stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed . \nhis placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie . \nanne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here . \nshe is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves . \neven donald sutherland as a co-star can\'t save this movie from being a bust . \nso for an overall opinion : " the art of war " is a total waste of time . \nit\'s not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed . \nit is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all . \nif you really want to see a good version of " the art of war " , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind " rising sun " , it isn\'t a great film either , but at least it\'s better than this . \n'

aS'movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable . \ni originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in \'95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . \nwe need to be warned about some truly awful films , too . \nthis picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . \nthe only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno . \nso , it does indeed have some plusses . . . \nin fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff . \nand her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone . \nthis character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) \nfar too annoying far too often . \nlike in 1998s " bulworth " , when the movie was over i didn\'t care one little iota about the main character . \nat least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though . \n " showgirls " is too stupid to make a statement . \nsome people claim that the story is based on the legendary " all about eve " of all things ! \nif exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he\'d be . . . well , \nhe\'d be a good screenwriter . \ninstead , this project may have sunk his career . \nhe wrote the ( ha ha ! ) \nscript and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed . \nthe same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( " basic instinct " ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones . \nthe predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer . \nafter the supposed street-smart young " lady " gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the " stardust hotel " . \nnomi doesn\'t take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away . \nfirst , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club . \nshe sells her hot little wares at " the cheetah " for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience . \nhey , i never said she wasn\'t a hot number . . . \nmaybe it\'s that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the " stardust hotel " , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn\'t her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) . \ncrystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) . \nhe also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show . \ncrystal gets nomi onto the " stardust " team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi " earns " the role of crystal\'s understudy . \nthe slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal . \nit was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she\'s " not a whore " . \nthat\'s a phrase we hear a few different times and it\'s completely ludicrous . \nof course she is ! \nshe sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we\'re supposed to believe that she\'s a better person than that . \nwe\'re supposed to root for her . \nno way ! \nshe\'s a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax . \nshe is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is . \nthe sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more . \nit sure ain\'t character development ! \nplummer also appeared in " speed " in \'94 in a smaller , yet better role . \nthis sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control . \nkyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in " blue velvet " . \nthat picture was weird , but some critics claim it\'s one of the best movies of the \'80s . \nnow ol\' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the \'90s , too . \nhis sleazy character is important to " showgirls " , but we don\'t learn anything about him . \nhe uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie . \nis he a villain ? \nwho cares ! \nultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit . \neveryone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool . \nwhat few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is . \neveryone\'s either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge . \nit\'s just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) . \nif we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn\'t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ? \nit\'s hard to care about these people if we can\'t even appreciate what they\'re capable of doing on-stage . \nberkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body . \nafter all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession . \nperhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford . \noops , they\'re bad actors , too . \nwell , at least , they\'re not selfish and contemptable like good ol\' slutty nomi malone . \nuseless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and " holier than thou " jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , " saved by the bell " , before breaking onto the big screen . \n'

aS"mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . \na weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . \nhowever , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . \njackie chan plays , who else , jackie . \nthis time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . \nnot that it ever makes a difference in the plot . \nthere are only two scenes of him cooking . \nfor the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . \nit never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? \na tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . \nalthough she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , \nshades of broadcast news ? ? ? \nanyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . \nhere lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? \noh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . \nas luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . \nthis leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . \nin a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . \nhowever , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases . \nstrangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . \nwhether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . \nthe plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . \nbut even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . \nlook , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? \nwatching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . \nthe action is a mixed bag here . \nthere's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . \nit takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . \nthe action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . \nthe film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . \nonce or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . \nbut to slo-mo jackie running ? \neither this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . \nif you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . \nhowever , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop . \n"

" \nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it\'s not even worth mentioning . \ndirector david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . \nwith crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i\'m surprised i didn\'t walk out . \nthis just goes to show that hype kills . \nit\'s very rare that a film so hyped up as " fight club " turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . \nthe story goes like this . \nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . \nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . \napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . \nwhy any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . \nnorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it\'s on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . \nthe two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . \nhow do they come up with this stuff ? \nanyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser\'s attention , and a club is formed . \nout of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . \nfincher shows us that society is like robots . \nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . \nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . \ncall me crazy , but this is common knowledge . \ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . \neven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . \ni couldn\'t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . \nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention . \ni guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . \nhis bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . \nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . \nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose . \nshe just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . \nthis continues for what seems like 6 hours . \nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while " fight club " nears what i think might be the end . \nunfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . \nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . \non a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . \nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . \nconcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won\'t do any good if everything else is in need of support . \nalso , i\'m afraid that immature men might respond to the film\'s violence . \nthe last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . \nwhen the film ends , i\'m just glad to get home and take some advil . \nyou\'ll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says " this is so f * * * ing stupid . " \n'

aS'note to screenwriters and self : when you hit the big time , and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer , tell ? em all to hit the road . \ngilligan wrote the arbitrarily-titled home fries ten years ago ; it was shelved until he found success as one of " the took a second look at gilligan\'s " comedy " - they read it again wearing rose-tinted glasses . \ndrew stars as sally , a dim ( but sweet ) , pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states . \nthe father of her child is dead , the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons - these flyboys scared him with their low-flying helicopter . \ndorian ( wilson ) and angus ( busey ) were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother ( o\'hara ) . \ntrouble is , sally picked up some interference on her drive-thru headset , and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing . \nso dorian goes undercover as a burger-flipper ; before you can say " with cheese " he falls for the mother-to-be . \ntoo bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally . \ndoes this sound like a movie you want to see ? \nwithout a doubt , the best thing about home fries is barrymore ; at the risk of sounding sexist , she\'s never looked better than here , as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes . \nshe is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple-cheek cute and gawk at wilson , her real-life boyfriend . \nbut the plot and the situations are so off-putting that nothing could save it . \nthis movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers , but home fries\' brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel . \nit\'s raising arizona without babies , without charm , without laughs , without human characters , and without intelligence ; worst of all , it\'s creepy . \nwhat\'s funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun ? \n ( unless the woman in question is a spice girl . ) \ntake out the helicopters , the quasi-incestuous relationship between the mother and her sons ( it is absolutely illogical , within the movie\'s framework , that dorian still lives with his mother and brother ) , and the scenes of murder ( attempted and otherwise ) , and what are you left with ? \nthe story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint ( but dreams of becoming a country singer ) . \nthat could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made , but it\'d be better than home fries . \n'

aS'the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from " l . a . confidential " to " palmetto " to " the big lebowski , " has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors . \nwith this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir . \n " wild things " could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol\' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn\'t qualify for is that of a quality motion picture . \noveracted , overwrought and overlong , " wild things " is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too . \nwith its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness . \nin spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , " wild things " not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there\'s not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical . \ndirected by john mcnaughton ( " henry : portrait of a serial killer " ) , " wild things " follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who\'s the dream of every spruced up female in the community . \nparticularly one . \nkelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner . \nsoon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house . \nnext thing , she cries rape . \nand the so-called " roller-coaster ride " ensues . \na second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin\' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen . \neven bill murray gets into the act as lombardo\'s zany lawyer . \nhe wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray . \nyou can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role . \nas ridiculous as it sounds , he\'s the most sane character in the movie . \nthe community is astonished . \nreporters flee to the scene . \nthere\'s an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly\'s mother ( theresa russell ) . \nthere\'s the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust . \nwe , the audience , sniff something not so lustful . \nlike so many thrillers these days , including " the usual suspects " and " the game , " " wild things " eschews character for plot . \nmcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he\'s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany " henry , " a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force . \ngeorge clinton\'s score is a delight to behold . \nbut it\'s the humans . \nthe characters are mere devices for the " nasty " twists . \nwhat writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don\'t feel real or we don\'t care for them . \nnot even the unintentionally funny moments work . \nthe people in " wild things " are not so much people as they are caricatures . \nthen there\'s the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois . \nand in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon\'s member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go . \nironically , the wildest elements of " wild things " are not wild at all . \n'

aS'it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film . \nthey seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like . \n ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . ) \nthey also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user\'s answer to deep impact . \nbruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet . \nwhy an oil driller ? \nthey require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . \n ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) \nhilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . \nwe trust nasa to build space shuttles ? ) \nharry assembles the obligatory " ragtag " bunch of " cowboys " , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . \nonce they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . \nwhether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . \nnor will you care . \ni will say this : you know you\'re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . \nwillis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . \ntheir big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . \nsteve buscemi\'s character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . \n " rockhound " , as he\'s called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . \nso why did they bring him up there to begin with ? \nrather , why write him into the film ? -give \nhis almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . \ni\'m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . \nliv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father\'s band\'s ( " aerosmith " ) songs grace the soundtrack . \ndirector michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . \n ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate\'s brain . ) \nwhenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out " we lost ( insert dead person\'s last name here ) ! " \ni must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses\' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . \narmageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . \nit looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . \nit has a vivid soundmix . \nbut at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . \nthe love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . \nbollocks ! \nthe lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . \nremember a little film called jaws ? \nin this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . \nthey didn\'t much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . \none of jaws\' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . \nthis is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we\'ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . \nnot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i\'d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before " action " was called . \na male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don\'t bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . \nto this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn\'t build a birdhouse . \nand if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i\'ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life . \n'

aS'there\'s a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . \ni\'d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . \nthe early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . \ndeep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . \nthe repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there\'s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nthen we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . \nthe mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there\'s a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nit goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . \nhow do we know this ? \nbecause we\'ve seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that " the comet is still headed right for us " and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . \nladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . \nsuccessful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . \ntelevision is what\'s wrong with deep impact . \nthe main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that\'s the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . \nshe thinks it\'s an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . \nwhen she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . \n " i know you\'re just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . " \nshe figures out what\'s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . \nupon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . \nand everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you\'re a star . \nleoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet\'s collision course with earth . \nand i\'m sure it\'s comforting for her to know that , even though the world\'s ending in a matter of months , she\'s a cable news personality . \nso there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . \nsuch personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . \nbut as anyone who\'s seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . \nthey only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . \nyeah , thanks , nasa . \nthat\'s when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren\'t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . \nthey even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . \nif the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . \ninstead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . \nthe reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . \nand , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . \ni\'m sure it\'s comforting to know that , even though the world\'s ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . \n'

aS' " there will be another , " the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? \ntrue , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994\'s the crow , anyway . \nthe idea of spinning artist james o\'barr\'s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . \ngiven that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions . \nof course , it doesn\'t . \nstubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee\'s eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death . \ni remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality . \nin flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind . \nit\'s loud and repetitive , true , a sadist\'s delight -- but it\'s also horrifying and fascinating . \ncity of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully . \nthere\'s an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won\'t be much of a success . \nin fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings . \n ( i\'ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) \nso much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . \nthis time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . \nperez might have some screen presence if he\'s given something to do with himself , but here he\'s simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . \nat first , he\'s shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . \nhe\'s befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . \nkirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . \ntattooed with angels\' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress . \nthe gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . \niggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . \nlike all good things here , he\'s dispatched too soon and without much imagination . \nin the meantime , we\'re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah\'s compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren\'t distinctly secondhand . \neven the soundtrack is tired . \nmore than anything i\'ve seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it\'s a movie with a lousy script but a great look . \ncritics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn\'t that bad per se . \nhe\'s got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . \nhis major stylistic failing is that he can\'t seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . \nbut as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn\'t , the performers who couldn\'t , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . \nwho bought david s . goyer\'s anemic script , anyway ? \nthe producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference . \n'

aS'late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an " artificial conversation " with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . \nthe irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . \nthe film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial . \nfilled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . \nprinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles\' freshman co-ed . \nat first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how " cute " it can be . \nthe happy couple " psychoanalyze " each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze\'s dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love . \nthen , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart . \nwhy ? \nwell , because they have to . \notherwise the couple can\'t make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . \ndown to you exists outside the realm of normal logic . \nscenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . \na picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . \nthe supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . \nstiles\' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze\'s roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can\'t meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) . \nhe is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film . \nyou know , the average porn star . \nthe costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he\'s on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . \nshe is a porn star mostly so we know she\'s slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . \nattempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up . \nthese characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes . \nwhat happened here ? \nthe cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) . \nwriter/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off . \nin fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year\'s extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . \nthe direction is film-school-grad obvious . \nit\'s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of " cops , " characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . \nplus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . \nthis is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she\'s all that . \nif he doesn\'t start making better choices fast his future films won\'t be so lucky . \n'

aS"for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers . \napparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . \nin other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid . \nmadonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp . \nshe's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover . \nalready two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men . \nwhat's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well . \nmadonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition . \n ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy . \nthis movie leave no scummy stone unturned . ) \nanyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality . \nhow do we know this ? \nbecause his character is set up with the token wife and kids . \nhow obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ? \nand get kicked out of the house ? \nand get welcomed back anyway ? \ndon't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up . \ndafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie . \nmost of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs . \ndon't ask . \nanother thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it's insanely dull . \nwhat's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes . \nthe stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes . \nthe thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor . \nand the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ? \n-- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in . \nthe director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn't a meal ticket , it's leftovers . \n"

aS'it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . \nthe academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . \nit also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . \nwhat i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . \nwhat drags braveheart down is its screenplay . \nit abounds with high production values : john toll\'s award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick\'s 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . \nbut this does not save a misguided script . \nthe film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer\'s only response to his " heroism " is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . \nbut wallace\'s actions paint a different story . \nhe speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . \nthough one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . \nwallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . \nafter kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . \nthis is evident of a " spartacus complex " , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . \nthe historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . \nit is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . \nhorner\'s score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . \ngibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . \nthis drags down any emotional connection to the film\'s plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time . \n'

aS'susan granger\'s review of " the watcher " ( universal ) \njust what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga . \nthis time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd . \nto taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too . \nbefore long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again . \nin the midst of this murderous frenzy , there\'s spader\'s psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in " the cell . " \nwriters david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves\' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop " need each other to give meaning to our lives . " \nplus , as reeves explains , " we\'re all stacked right on top of each other , but we don\'t notice each other any more .

aS"ahh yes . \nthe teenage romance . \nan attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl . \nand with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity . \nalong now comes `down to you' . \nthe folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all . \nonly `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above . \nit is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to . \nthis is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing . \nin strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) . \nthey hit it off like a couple can only in the movies . \nfrom here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story . \nthe plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . . \nwell , only happen in the movies . \nfortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal . \nfreddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around . \nzak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue . \nrounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) . \neven the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' . \nmaybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd . \nas a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely . \nperhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny . \nthe jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired . \nthe characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience . \neven the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course . \nthe one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) . \nwhen this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired . \nin order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity . \n`10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing . \nno such luck with `down to you' . \nit's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end . \nand at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . . \nonly in the movies' . \n"

aS' " virus " is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it . \nstrangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , " deep rising , " about an ugly monster on a cruise liner . \nprior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989\'s " leviathan , " 1989\'s " deep star six , " and all four " alien " pictures . \n " virus , " in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn\'t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on . \nbased on a series of comic books , " virus " concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon . \nafter discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen . \nonce the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted . \nafter turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself . \none survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out . \nif " virus " sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you\'re correct . \nalthough the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn\'t appear to have a brain in its head . \nthe film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the " creature " genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film . \nthe actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play . \nin her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it . \nalthough 1998\'s " halloween : h20 " was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here . \ndonald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994\'s " the puppet masters , " although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic " invasion of the body snatchers , " where he was fabulous . \nthe last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do . \nbasically , " virus " is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one . \nit is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ? \nas long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never . \n'

aS'over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind\'s nuclear testing . \npartly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . \na year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . \nas godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . \nthirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . \nnow it\'s 14 years after toho\'s remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . \nin emmerich\'s godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . \nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . \nmeanwhile , tatopoulos\'s college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . \nshe\'d like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . \nof course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor " animal " palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey\'s trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . \ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . \nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation\'s premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . \nhe didn\'t . \nright up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . \nthe plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it\'s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . \nthe script , however , is painfully bad . \nit\'s fraught with lines so corny , they don\'t even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , " you idiot , " or " you stupid girl . " \ni suppose when you\'ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . \nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? \nwhy do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? \nwhy do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? \nwhy is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? \nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . \nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he\'s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . \nhank azaria does what he can , but don\'t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . \nlike broderick\'s , azaria\'s character is quite simply lacking in color . \nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . \ncasting must have been asleep on this one . \nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we\'ve seem him do in the past . \nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . \nunfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . \nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . \nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . \nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . \nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? \nif we can\'t take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don\'t care what happens to them . \ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . \nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here\'s a behemoth running through the city ! \nthere\'s bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . \njoe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm\'s way just in time . \nin a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . \nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . \nit\'s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . \nconsider another punch pulled . \nthrough creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn\'t just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . \nit made me want to gag . \nemmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . \nwith an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . \nhowever , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn\'t work . \nnow if they only had raymond burr . . . . \n'

aS'before the remake of psycho appears , we\'ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder . \nas usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing . \nthe film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) \'having fun\' in an loft apartment . \nthe problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair . \nif i was paltrow , though , i\'d definitely go with mortensen . \nless wrinkles . \nanyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he\'ll pay him to kill his lovely wife . \nmortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses . \nunfortunately , the film dosen\'t progress very fast . \nin fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . ) \nthe plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts . \nnot too good for a \'thriller . \' \nalso , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par . \npaltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie . \nmortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn\'t meaty enough to show all his talent . \nwhich leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does . \nhowever , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside . \nalso popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective . \nagain , it\'s not a character we\'re seeing on the screen , it\'s david suchet . \nthe director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in\'s , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting . \nhowever , looks can\'t save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway . \nthe screenplay is o . k , but there\'s some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . \nthe characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel . \nwith a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment . \nthere are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between . \nthe last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn\'t be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder . \noverall rating= \nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \n " you know , for kids " - norville barnes \n'

aS"coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels . \nrelentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work . \ndivorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases . \nto make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation . \nfans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies . \nthey both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives . \nthis one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content . \nthe execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best . \nuseless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be . \nthe actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career . \nsigny coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast . \nbut she won't have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway . \n"

aS"edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back , and like his previous two , it is a working-class relationship picture . \nhowever , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist . \nand in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work . \nclaudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life . \nshe's at a turning point in her life , and feels as if she's going nowhere . \nher boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job . \nif she were to marry him , she'd never get a chance to escape this town . \nenter charlie ( edward burns ) , claudia's old flame . \nhe skipped town several years before , without any explanations . . . even \nfor claudia . \nhe has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn . \nshould she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown . . . or \nshould she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again . \npart of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) , who fell for the wrong man . . . and has spent her life pining for claudia's father to return . \nnow it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes . \nat only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre . \nunfortunately , it seems much much longer . \nthe storyline is simple and uninspired , and there's a lack of energy to the whole proceedings , which makes the entire drama rather tedious . \nedward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame . \nthere's no one to restrain his ego , which reigns unchecked . \nhe walks into the room and lauren holly swoons . . . yeah , \nright . \nlauren holly does what she can with her central character . \nbut we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions . . . and \nwe never really care . \nbon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie . \nhis acting talents are much greater than they might seem , but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with . \nthere's not much to recommend in no looking back . \nit's not that the film is bad . . . it's \nsimply boring . \nthere's no zest in any aspect of the film , and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it . \n"

aS'i don\'t expect much from eddie murphy these days . \nfor the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . \nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \nsherman has just invented a new " youth drink " that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the " buddy love " link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \npure and simple , the klumps is a failure . \nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . \nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . \nit\'s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . \nhey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . \nthe characterization of sherman\'s family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . \neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn\'t act like this all the time . \nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \neven the best effects can\'t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . \npeople will be lined up around the block for it . \nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . \neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he\'ll play every character in the movie . \ni just can\'t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \n'

aS'brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him . \nsadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters . \nnic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . ) \nan assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy . \nthe film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together . \nhowever , the film doesn\'t keep the mystery for long , and once the big \'secret\' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . \nalthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead . \nthe problem is that de palma doesn\'t have a strong story or characters to work with . \nhe tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored . \nnic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it\'s no use . \nthey are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable . \nyes , another problem with the film is that there\'s no-one to root for . \nwe\'re supposed to be on cage\'s side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . \nhowever , his change is sadly unbelievable . \npoor gary sinise\'s character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way . \nthe film\'s use of flashback quickly gets boring . \nwhile clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go . \nthey certainly don\'t increase the tension or suspense of the movie . \nthere is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn\'t make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one . \nthe script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional . \ncertainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . \nthe most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . \nthere\'s a good story buried in snake eyes , it\'s just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . \nit also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end . \nwhile the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy \'number cruncher\' wrapped up in the case , there\'s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you\'re a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided . \na david wilcock review ? 1998 \n " you know , for kids " - norville barnes \n'

aS'it\'s now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james\' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends . \nstill besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . \nshe can\'t concentrate on her schoolwork , can\'t get a good night\'s sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club . \neverywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand . \nin the first movie , `i know what you did last summer\' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway . \nto cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean . \nhowever , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends . \njulie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal . \nneeding some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island . \naccompanying these two girls are karla\'s overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie . \nbut was this contest too good to be true ? \nthe resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects . \nmeanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin . \nthis presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island . \neventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms . \nas you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook . \njulie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing " i will survive " at the karaoke bar and the words scroll " i still know . . . " ) , but her friends chalk it up to paranoia . \nbut the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it\'s going to be the worst vacation of her life . \nthe funny ( yes , i used the word \'funny\' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming . \nthis movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness . \nthere isn\'t even any suspense that leads up to the deaths . \nhere\'s an appropriate example . \nknock-knock . \n " housekeeping " , says the diminuitive cleaning lady . \nthe door suddenly opens up . \nslash . \nnext victim ! \nis there any reason to go and see this movie ? \nnot unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes . \nbut i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me . \ni was thoroughly irritated with tyrell , who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido . \ni secretly wished for him to get filleted . \ndid he get \'hooked\' ? \nwell , let\'s just say that if he didn\'t , i would give this film a grade of " d " . \n'

' \nopening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game . \nthe plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade . \nhowever , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . ) \nthey also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) \nstar wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters . \nthe script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic . \nthe trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent . \nthere's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is . \nthe film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help . \nthere's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod . \nthe script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother . \nthere's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen . \nthe two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it . \nqui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for . \nthe audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time . \nmaul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . ) \nanakin is annoying and unlikeable . , \ninstead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended . \nit's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible . \nthe comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him . \nalthough his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny . \nthe only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while . \nqueen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin . \nagain , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here . \nthe actors don't help the movie much either . \nliam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible . \nmcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm . \nthe casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it . \nnatalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . \nand jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice . \nthere's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there . \nhe's not even very 'cute . ' \nthe main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay . \nthere's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well . \nthe cgi takes away much of the human element , however . \nthe battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers . \nepisode 1 is just disappointing . \nit's got high production values , but little else . \nthe music is meandering , except near the end . \nthe plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . \nthe effects are nice , but dull . \nthe plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . \nthere's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . \napart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film . \ndisappointing is barely the word . \nrating= \n"

aS'five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake . \nthe girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn\'t see that one coming ! ) . \nhard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . # \n1521 ) . \ntwo of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here . \norville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) . \nyes , he is also built like a tank in this film too . \ni\'m telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn\'t harm him at all ! \nthe before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability . \nthankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film . \nthe story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks . \nany good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line . \nthe film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens . \nthere is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot . \nwhile we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . \nthe film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager\'s office . \ni\'m sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) . \nthe script for this film is completely pathetic . \nthe lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible . \nthe only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . \nhere is an example of the wonderful dialog . \nthe scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun . \nthe line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . " \nthis line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy . \nnow , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented . \none comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . " \ni\'m afraid folks that this is about as good as they get . \nnow lets talk about the great special effects for this film . \nthis obviously wasn\'t a big concern of the film makers . \nthe killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer\'s intelligence . \na girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie . \nare we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? \nthe continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film . \nin one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing . \nvery impressive trick ! \nthe one ( half ? ) \nplus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious . \nthe incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film . \nhowever , this doesn\'t make it worth the rental fee of over a penny . \nin the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . \ni would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least . \noh well , win some , lose some . \n'

aS'the first film produced by adam sandler\'s happy madison production company ( clever title eh ? ) is essentially a one joke movie , much like the movies sandler stars in himself . \nhowever the difference here is that this one joke just isn\'t very funny . \nrob schneider stars as the title character , a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a " man-whore " to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client\'s custom made fish tank , which deuce destroyed while staying in his home . \ndeuce goes on numerous " dates " , and each woman he goes out with has a " humorous " quirk about herself . \none has narcolepsy , one has tourette\'s syndrome , one is a man . . . \netc . etc . \nmy problem is that we see all of these women in the film\'s trailer , so why do i need to watch the movie ? \nseen the trailer . . . \nseen the film . \nonly a quick cameo from norm macdonald ( and a follow up joke during the closing credits ) generates any chuckles . \ndeuce bigalow : male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video ( a division of di$ney ) . \nthe disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and features the original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for mystery alaska , happy texas , and outside providence ) , an extremely brief production featurette ( which contains footage not used in the film ) , and storyboard-to-scene comparisons . \nyep , you read that right . . . \nthere are storyboard comparisons on this dvd . \ntwo scenes are storyboarded . . . \nneither of which are particularly exciting . \nthere are fight scenes in this movie , so why aren\'t we seeing storyboards of those segments ( especially the parody moments from the matrix ) ? \ni wonder what\'s funnier : the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them ? \ndeleted scenes ? \nsure . \naudio commentary ? \nyou betcha . \nbut storyboards ? \ncome on . \n[r] \n'

aS'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \nit\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , " look ! \nart ! " ) , \nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \nbecause we\'re constantly made aware that we\'re watching a play or a movie , it\'s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer\'s ideas . \nthey\'re not real , sympathetic , or believable . \ni\'m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn\'t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren\'t bilingual ) . \nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it\'s different , ( b ) it\'s not like anything they\'ve seen before , and ( c ) it\'s pretentious . \nfor everyone else , it\'s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \n'

aS'various films seen at the seattle film festival : \nit\'s all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles \na recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle\'s planned " docu-drama " of amazing stories around the world named it\'s all true , this short dealt with welle\'s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . \nwhile several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle\'s attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . \nimpressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians . \nsadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play " rain " , based on w . somerset maugham\'s story " miss thompson " cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent \nafter the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra\'s lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . \nthis is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story " miss thompson " . \nthis is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . \nthe actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie\'s soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . \nswanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . \nunfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . \nthe happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham\'s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we\'ve been waiting an hour and a half for . \nstill , it\'s entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore\'s incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . \na c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . \nthe pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza \nthis is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids . \nit tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it . \nperhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn\'t show capitalism in a good light . \nnor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter . \nas you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over . \nnot that it wasn\'t interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done . \nall the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats . \nboy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn\'t it ? \nadd onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . \nsome gore . \ndon\'t bring children to this one . \ndon\'t bring adults to this one , unless they\'re fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped . \nblech . \n . no fun whatsoever . \nmeier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled \nthis film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . \nhis uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . \nmeier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . \nafter a round-the-world trip ( his boss think\'s he\'s on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew\'s work--while everyone think\'s he\'s still living in east germany . \nof course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . \nthe humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . \nstill , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . \nc -- $2 . 50 . \nthe right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements \nafter a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i\'ve learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : \n1 ) be wary of french comedies . \nthese people like jerry lewis . \n2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . \n3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as " old pouty-lips " is probably not worth watching . \n4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! \naustralia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . \nwell , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . \nit\'s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30\'s about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . \nlots and lots of horses . \nthe film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . \nunfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . \nhighlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor\'s daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it\'s raining--you\'d think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . \nthe photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . \nactually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that\'s life . \ngrade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you\'re looking for inadvertent yuks . \n'

aS'capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . \nalien 3 ( the " 3 " should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . \nit continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . \nin fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it\'s so elegaic and limp . \na little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . \nat the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . \nunfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . \nthe pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . \nripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . \nthe prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it\'s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . \nlice are endemic , and so ripley\'s head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . \nat first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn\'t stay that way . \none of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . \nworse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . \nwhat\'s weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . \nthe supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they\'re not asked to do anything with it . \nin light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . \nit\'s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn\'t have driven the rest of it . \n'

aS' " from the director of " the nightmare before christmas " it said in the previews , which i\'m guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn\'t worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million . \nto each it\'s own however , since " monkey bone " is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made . \na tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects . \nstu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena " monkey bone " a crude comic strip , that everyone wants to merchandise , they go to great links to get it as well , including dollars that let out fart powder . \nwhen stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident ( you\'ll see ) stu goes into a coma , and while in his coma stu travels to i\'m guessing dark town , where all the characters in dreams come to life . \npeople are stuck in this town , with their nightmares roaming around them . \nwhen stu spots monkey bone ( whom he really can\'t stand ) he tries to keep him under control . \nmaking a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death , he can go back up and live his life . \nwhen monkey bone and stu steal a pass , monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu\'s body . \nnow monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder , so everyone has nightmares . . . or \nsomething like that . \nrather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) " monkey bone " had potential in the script and even the story . \nwhat is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development . \nfor instance we really don\'t get to know who stu or julie are , so why should we even care ? \nkitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her , but we are not given a chance to know her . \nthe cast is decent however , brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body . \nbridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt , her performance is bad and she seems miscast . \ndave foley isn\'t given enough to do , as well as " will & grace\'s " megan mullally who can be funny . \nthe standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust . \nthe special effects of " monkey bone " is what might really bring in some curious viewers , these special effects are highly effective , and nice to look at with the eyes . \nsome of them are believable and some unbelievable . . . for \nmonkey bone he seems to be like stuart little , you really don\'t realize that he is animated . . . but \non occasion it sneaks up on you . \nthe direction by henry selick is good , but at times he doesn\'t know what kind of film he wants to make , and the ending climax falls off the cliff . \nit\'s too bad really , " monkey bone " could have been a real good movie , but with it\'s heavily done hack job , and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role . \nfor those curious however , it might be worth the rental , but other than that avoid this one . \n'

aS'numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . \nsoldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . \nthe problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . \nbesides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . \nthe fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . \nrussell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . \nbesides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . \nthis movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . \nalthough this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable . \n'

aS'a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps , all of whom are african-american . \nan offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession . \nit is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho\'s , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get . \ni learned that the word " bitch " is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used . \nit makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing . \nthey seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money . \nit\'s also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place . \nthis sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears . \nthese verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face . \nthe hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late \'70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite . \nalso used as reference , was iceberg slim\'s best-seller pimp , the story of my life . \nwe meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd . \nthey readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp\'s ho ) , and the thrill they get from women giving them money . \nthese dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves . \n " priests need nuns , \'\' yaps c-note , a san francisco pimp . \n " doctors need nurses . \nso ho\'s need pimps . \'\' \nas he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors . \nthe race issue was brought up right from the film\'s onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he\'s the lowest form of human . \nwhile , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community . \nwe also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt , as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations . \nthe film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work . \nthere are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being " macks " and " players " or " real pimps " and " perpetrator pimps , " but no further clarity is attempted . \nit is also failed to get the women\'s side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word . \nthe film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame . \nthe only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to . \ndanny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp\'s wardrobe . \nwhile a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer . \n'

aS'much ado about nothing . \nah , how sweet the irony ! \nit\'s accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance . \nhe just doesn\'t " understand " shakespeare , you will hear them say . \nthe bard\'s work is apparently beyond criticism . \nwhat a load of old cobblers . \nif these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh\'s film of shakespeare\'s " comedy " much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it\'s time to get a life . \nget monty python . \nget woody allen . \nget john waters . \nwhatever . \njust get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy . \nand banish this nonsense to where it belongs . \ndrama and tragedy was shakespeare\'s strength . \nto my sensibilities - and i\'m no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever . \nno kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going . \nthe only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn\'t seen her in ages . \nbut boy , does she owe me one ! \ni won\'t spend too much time on the plot . \nbasically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older . \nthere\'s some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you\'d hardly know it . \nmind you , there\'s nothing wrong with the basic story . \ngood romantic comedies based on similar premises abound . \nnothing wrong with most of the cast , either . \nbranaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers . \nthe problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare\'s original text . \nlight comedy shouldn\'t be complex . \nyet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend . \nfor this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh . \nthe only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something . \nbut when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame . \nthis is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold . \nho , ho , ho , boy likes girl ! \nho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes ! \nho , ho , ho , she\'s so awfully clumsy ! \noh please ! \nthere\'s wit in here somewhere , i\'m told . \ni call it pretentious . \nsomething lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay . \nin the end , it\'s cringeworthy . \nwatching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience . \ncomedy ? \nbah , humbug ! \n'

aS'another formula \'feel good\' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like " waking ned devine , " and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the \'war on drugs\' is about to be escalated into colombia . \nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america\'s jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america\'s drug usage and drug supply . \nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \nthe film\'s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband\'s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace\'s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can\'t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn\'t want matthew to end up in jail . \nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \nthis \'unhip\' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \nummm !

aS' " love to kill " starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . \nat the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who\'s an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . \ndanza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . \neverything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . \nmuch confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza\'s begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . \nsound confusing ? \nit is . \ni think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . \nin some respects , it works . \nbut the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . \ncharacters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen . \nthe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman\'s sister . \nbut so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don\'t really care what happens to them . \nwell , i didn\'t , at least . \none thing i will give the movie is that it\'s a complete departure for tony danza . \nhere\'s a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who\'s ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing . \nhere , he plays a man who\'s just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it . \ni was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . \nmichael madsen is also good as an associate of danza\'s who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him . \nlike i said , it\'s not exactly a linear storyline . \n " love to kill " should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it\'s just too bad that the story doesn\'t really add up to much . \nthe stars deserved better , and so did the audience . \n'

aS'whether you like the beatles or not , nobody wants to see the bee gee\'s take on some of the fab four\'s best known songs . \nwell , maybe that\'s not true . \n . \n . \nmaybe you\'re curious , the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose . \nyou just have to know how bad bad can be . \nif that\'s the case , rejoice , because it was twenty years ago today ( or so ) that sgt . \npepper\'s lonely hearts club band was released ( unleashed ? ) to the world , and thanks to our modern technological advances , you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs . \nderived from the lyrics of various beatles\' songs , sgt . \npepper\'s tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song ( and album ) of the same name , released in 1967 . \nof course , the movie was made eleven years later , the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts , peter frampton is the one and only billy shears , and aside from being about a rock band , the story doesn\'t correlate to the song at all . \nand oh , what joy - we\'re the lovely audience they\'d like to take home with them . \ni don\'t think so . \nbut at least these characters are actually * people * in a beatles\' song , whereas other characters such as strawberry fields ( sandy farina ) gets her name from a song about a * place * called strawberry fields . \nthe debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it , because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes , embarrassing cameo appearances ( george burns ? ! \nsteve martin ? ! ? \nalice cooper ? ! ? ! ) , and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70\'s fashion and faces . \ncheck please ! \nthe plot is a bit unclear . \npeople with bad 70\'s hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of make-believe from an overly demented mr . rogers . \nmean mr . mustard ( frankie howerd ) somehow gets hold of all billy & co . \'s instruments , calling dr . maxwell edison ( steve martin with a silver hammer and an out-of-key singing voice ) , the sun king , marvin sunk ( alice cooper ! ) , and a couple of creepy robots to his aid . \nsupposedly this is a horrible thing ? \ni guess in heartland , the talent is pretty non-existent . \nmeanwhile , the lonely hearts are off doing the classic " sex , drugs , and rock n\' roll " thing , leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love , billy . \nshe sets out to find him , leaving her poor dad and mom ( mrs . \nfields ! \nhey , wanna cookie ? ) \nall alone to sing a horrible rendition of " she\'s leaving home " , accompanied by those same creepy robots . \nbut is billy getting it on with lucy ( dianne steinberg ) ? \nya know , the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky ? \nwell , there\'s some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop , and i assume that\'s who it was . \nit\'s movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question , " what the hell were they thinking ? ? ? " \nnobody will ever know , but as a novelty , sgt . \npepper\'s is one to examine . \ncarol channing , robert palmer , keith carradine - they\'re all here . \nbut why ? ? ? ? \nwho knows . \nit\'s irrelevant . \nthere\'s as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your belly-button lint , although the latter may be more interesting . \nwith the recent onslaught of 70\'s nostalgia in the movie world ( the ice storm , boogie nights , reissues of the star wars trilogy , etc . ) , let\'s pray this doesn\'t get a special 20th anniversary , second-chance in theaters . \nin the words of paul mccartney , live and let die . \nin fact , bury this one while you still can . \n'
